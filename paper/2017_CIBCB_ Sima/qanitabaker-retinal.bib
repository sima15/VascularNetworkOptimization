    abstract = {{Neovascular (?wet?) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among Caucasians over the age of 55 in the USA and is an important cause of ocular morbidity worldwide. Progress in oncology, and more recently ophthalmology, led to the development of VEGF antagonists, three of which are now approved for the treatment of wet AMD. Recent discoveries in ophthalmology and vascular biology, however, suggest that combined inhibition of VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) may be more beneficial than inhibition of VEGF alone. Accordingly, numerous studies are underway to evaluate the role of anti-VEGF/PDGF combination therapies for the treatment of wet AMD. This review discusses the biology of VEGF and PDGF and current preclinical and clinical data exploring the use of combined VEGF/PDGF inhibitors in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.}},

    abstract = {{Morgan and colleagues demonstrated that the RPE cell mosaic can be resolved in the living human eye non-invasively by imaging the short-wavelength autofluorescence using an adaptive optics (AO) ophthalmoscope. This method, based on the assumption that all subjects have the same longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) correction, has proved difficult to use in diseased eyes, and in particular those affected by age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this work, we improve Morgan's method by accounting for chromatic aberration variations by optimizing the confocal aperture axial and transverse placement through an automated iterative maximization of image intensity. The increase in image intensity after algorithmic aperture placement varied depending upon patient and aperture position prior to optimization but increases as large as a factor of 10 were observed. When using a confocal aperture of 3.4 Airy disks in diameter, images were obtained using retinal radiant exposures of less than 2.44 J/cm(2), which is \~{}22 times below the current ANSI maximum permissible exposure. RPE cell morphologies that were strikingly similar to those seen in postmortem histological studies were observed in AMD eyes, even in areas where the pattern of fluorescence appeared normal in commercial fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images. This new method can be used to study RPE morphology in AMD and other diseases, providing a powerful tool for understanding disease pathogenesis and progression, and offering a new means to assess the efficacy of treatments designed to restore RPE health.}},

    abstract = {{Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) are pleiotropic lipid mediators known to induce proangiogenic and proinflammatory cellular effects that are increasingly recognized to be involved in a number of physiologic and pathologic processes in the retina. Immunohistochemical studies have detected OxPLs in retinal structures, such as retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or photoreceptor cells. This study analyzed whether OxPLs could play a role in upregulation of VEGF, which is a cause of pathological neovascularization characteristic of eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. We confirmed accumulation of OxPLs in the eye using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Multiple species of oxidized phosphatidylcholines (OxPCs) were detected in human vitreous, including biologically active fragmented species POVPC, PGPC, PONPC and PAzPC. In in vitro experiments human fetal RPE and primary RPE cells were stimulated with OxPLs. Primary RPE cells were transfected with small interfering RNAs targeting ATF4. mRNA levels of VEGF in fetal and primary RPE cells were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. VEGF protein concentrations were measured in culture medium by ELISA. We found that OxPCs and other classes of OxPLs upregulated the expression of VEGF in fetal and primary RPE cells, which critically depended on ATF4. In addition, upregulation of VEGF in primary RPE cells was blocked by a chemical inhibitor of protein kinase CK2 known to suppress induction of ATF4 and VEGF by OxPLs. Our data show that different species of OxPLs, which are present in the human eye are capable of stimulating expression of VEGF in fetal and primary RPE cells via ATF4-dependent mechanisms.

@article{qanitabaker:Duh1999Vascular,
    abstract = {{Much of the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes is primarily attributable to sequelae of microvascular and macrovascular disease. Over the past decade, dramatic progress has been achieved in elucidating the fundamental processes underlying the pathogenesis of these complications. Angiogenic factors in particular now appear to play a pivotal role in the development of microvascular complications as well as the response to macrovascular disease. Hyperglycemia, other growth factors, advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, and ischemia can increase growth factor expression. In some microvascular tissues, the result is pathologic neovascularization and increased vascular permeability. These responses account for much of the visual loss associated with diabetic retinopathy and may, in addition, serve a significant role in nephropathy and neuropathy. In contrast, recent data suggest that vascular collateralization resulting from ischemia-induced growth factor release in tissues compromised by macrovascular disease may be important in reducing clinical symptoms and tissue damage. This angiogenic response, which may be beneficial in coronary artery and peripheral limb disease, appears to be reduced in patients with diabetes. Thus, two apparently diametrically opposed therapeutic paradigms are arising for the treatment of vascular complications in diabetes. Indeed, growth factor antagonists have been used successfully in diabetes-related animal models to block angiogenic and permeability complications in the retina and kidney. Conversely, growth factor agonists have been successfully used to stimulate collateral vessel formation and reduce ischemic symptoms from macrovascular disease in the coronary arteries and peripheral limbs. Both of these approaches are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for their respective indications. Thus, as these divergent therapeutic modalities begin to enter the clinical arena, this apparent paradox necessitates careful consideration of the potential risks, benefits, and interactions of the opposing regimens. Using vascular endothelial growth factor as a classic example of growth factor involvement, we discuss the current preclinical and clinical data supporting these approaches and the implications arising from the probable coexistence of these two therapeutic modalities.}},

Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, Aβ1–40 (Aβ40) and Aβ1–42 (Aβ42), have been implicated previously in the AMD disease process. Consistent with a pathogenic role for Aβ, we show here that a mouse model of AMD that invokes multiple factors that are known to modify AMD risk (aged human apolipoprotein E 4 targeted replacement mice on a high-fat, cholesterol-enriched diet) presents with Aβ-containing deposits basal to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), histopathologic changes in the RPE, and a deficit in scotopic electroretinographic response, which is reflective of impaired visual function. Strikingly, these electroretinographic deficits are abrogated in a dose-dependent manner by systemic administration of an antibody targeting the C termini of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Concomitant reduction in the levels of Aβ and activated complement components in sub-RPE deposits and structural preservation of the RPE are associated with anti-Aβ40/42 antibody immunotherapy and visual protection. These observations are consistent with the reduction in amyloid plaques and improvement of cognitive function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease treated with anti-Aβ antibodies. They also implicate Aβ in the pathogenesis of AMD and identify Aβ as a viable therapeutic target for its treatment.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Angiogenesis is a process by which new capillaries are formed from pre-existing blood vessels in physiological (e.g., exercise, wound healing) or pathological (e.g., ischemic limb as in peripheral arterial disease, cancer) contexts. This neovascular mechanism is mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of cytokines. Although VEGF is often targeted in anti-angiogenic therapies, there is little knowledge about how its concentration may vary between tissues and the vascular system. A compartment model is constructed to study the VEGF distribution in the tissue (including matrix-bound, cell surface receptor-bound and free VEGF isoforms) and in the blood. We analyze the sensitivity of this distribution to the secretion rate, clearance rate and vascular permeability of VEGF.RESULTS:We find that, in a physiological context, VEGF concentration varies approximately linearly with the VEGF secretion rate. VEGF concentration in blood but not in tissue is dependent on the vascular permeability of healthy tissue. Model simulations suggest that relative VEGF increases are similar in blood and tissue during exercise and return to baseline within several hours. In a pathological context (tumor), we find that blood VEGF concentration is relatively insensitive to increased vascular permeability in tumors, to the secretion rate of VEGF by tumors and to the clearance. However, it is sensitive to the vascular permeability in the healthy tissue. Finally, the VEGF distribution profile in healthy tissue reveals that about half of the VEGF is complexed with the receptor tyrosine kinase VEGFR2 and the co-receptor Neuropilin-1. In diseased tissues, this binding can be reduced to 15\% while VEGF bound to the extracellular matrix and basement membranes increases.CONCLUSION:The results are of importance for physiological conditions (e.g., exercise) and pathological conditions (e.g., peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery disease, cancer). This mathematical model can serve as a tool for understanding the VEGF distribution in physiological and pathological contexts as well as a foundation to investigate pro- or anti-angiogenic strategies.}},

    abstract = {{Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of angiogenesis – the growth of new microvessels from existing microvasculature. Angiogenesis is a complex process involving numerous molecular species, and to better understand it, a systems biology approach is necessary. In vivo preclinical experiments in the area of angiogenesis are typically performed in mouse models; this includes drug development targeting VEGF. Thus, to quantitatively interpret such experimental results, a computational model of VEGF distribution in the mouse can be beneficial. In this paper, we present an in silico model of VEGF distribution in mice, determine model parameters from existing experimental data, conduct sensitivity analysis, and test the validity of the model. The multiscale model is comprised of two compartments: blood and tissue. The model accounts for interactions between two major VEGF isoforms (VEGF120 and VEGF164) and their endothelial cell receptors VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and co-receptor neuropilin-1. Neuropilin-1 is also expressed on the surface of parenchymal cells. The model includes transcapillary macromolecular permeability, lymphatic transport, and macromolecular plasma clearance. Simulations predict that the concentration of unbound VEGF in the tissue is approximately 50-fold greater than in the blood. These concentrations are highly dependent on the VEGF secretion rate. Parameter estimation was performed to fit the simulation results to available experimental data, and permitted the estimation of VEGF secretion rate in healthy tissue, which is difficult to measure experimentally. The model can provide quantitative interpretation of preclinical animal data and may be used in conjunction with experimental studies in the development of pro- and anti-angiogenic agents. The model approximates the normal tissue as skeletal muscle and includes endothelial cells to represent the vasculature. As the VEGF system becomes better characterized in other tissues and cell types, the model can be expanded to include additional compartments and vascular elements.}},

    abstract = {{Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) induces proliferation and differentiation in a wide variety of cells of mesodermal and neuroectodermal origin. FGF1 has no 'classical' signal sequence to direct its secretion, and there has been considerable debate concerning FGF1 secretion and its role in the biological activities of FGF1. We investigated the effects of FGF1 secretion and the signalling induced by signal peptide (SP)-containing FGFI and SP-less FGF1, on the proliferation and the apoptosis in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. Primary RPE cell cultures were transfected with FGF1 (FGF1 cells) and SP-FGF1 (SP-FGF1 cells) cDNAs. SP-FGF1 cells secreted large amount of FGF1 and actively proliferated, whereas FGF1 and control cells did not. Secreted FGF1 induced short-term activation of both FGFR1 and ERK2, which were required for cell proliferation. In contrast, SP-FGF1 cells stopped secreting FGF1 and died rapidly, if cultured in the absence of serum. Surprisingly, FGF1 cells, but not control cells, secreted FGF1 and were resistant to apoptosis induced by serum depletion. Secreted FGF1 induced long-term activation of FGFR1 and ERK2, which was necessary to induce a constant and high level of Bcl-x production, and to induce cell survival in FGFI cells. Downregulation of ERK2 and Bcl-x increased apoptosis. Thus, the proliferation and survival activities of FGF1 depend on the secretion of FGF1 which is determined by the cell culture conditions. Cell proliferation was SP-dependent, whereas cell survival was not. The signal peptide controls the level and duration, 'whispering or shouting', of ERK2 activation cells which determines FGF1 biological function and may have important implications for anti-degenerative and anti-proliferative treatments.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Stone1995Development,
    abstract = {{We have studied the role of the hypoxia-inducible angiogenic growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the induction and control of vessel growth in the developing retina of rats and cats, using in situ hybridization techniques. VEGF is expressed successively in two layers of neural retina, the innermost (axon) layer and the inner nuclear layer (INL). In the axon layer, VEGF is expressed transiently by astrocytes as they spread across the layer, closely preceding the formation of superficial vessels. In the INL, VEGF is expressed transiently by somas at the middle of the layer (presumably M\"{u}ller cells), closely preceding the formation of the deep layer of retinal vessels. We propose that hypoxia caused by the onset of neuronal activity is detected by strategically located populations of neuroglia, first astrocytes, then M\"{u}ller cells. In response they secrete VEGF, inducing formation of the superficial and deep layers of retinal vessels, respectively. As the vessels become patent, they relieve the hypoxic stimulus, so vessel formation is matched to oxygen demand. This hypothesis was tested experimentally in three ways. Expression of the high affinity flk-1 receptor for VEGF was demonstrated in newly formed retinal vessels, confirming that the secreted VEGF acts on the vessels, in a paracrine fashion. Direct hypoxic regulation of VEGF expression by macroglia was demonstrated in primary cultures of astrocytes and in cells of a glioma line. Hypoxic regulation of VEGF expression in the intact developing retina was demonstrated by showing that oxygen-enriched atmospheres that inhibit vessel formation also suppress endogenous VEGF production.}},

The endothelial cell-specific mitogen vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major mediator of pathological angiogenesis. Also, the expression of VEGF and its two receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR, is related to the formation of blood vessels in mouse and rat embryos. Mice homozygous for mutations that inactivate either receptor die in utero between days 8.5 and 9.5. However, ligand(s) other than VEGF might activate such receptors. To assess the role of VEGF directly, we disrupted the VEGF gene in embryonic stem cells. Here we report the unexpected finding that loss of a single VEGF allele is lethal in the mouse embryo between days 11 and 12. Angiogenesis and blood-island formation were impaired, resulting in several developmental anomalies. Furthermore, VEGF-null embryonic stem cells exhibit a dramatically reduced ability to form tumours in nude mice.}},

    abstract = {{This paper describes an approach to adhere retinal cells on micropatterned polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) lines adsorbed on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces using microfluidic networks. PEMs were patterned on flat, oxidized PDMS surfaces by sequentially flowing polyions through a microchannel network that was placed in contact with the PDMS surface. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) were the polyions used as the top layer cellular adhesion material. The microfluidic network was lifted off after the patterning was completed and retinal cells were seeded on the PEM/PDMS surfaces. The traditional practice of using blocking agents to prevent the adhesion of cells on unpatterned areas was avoided by allowing the PDMS surface to return to its uncharged state after the patterning was completed. The adhesion of rat retinal cells on the patterned PEMs was observed 5 h after seeding. Cell viability and morphology on the patterned PEMs were assayed. These materials proved to be nontoxic to the cells used in this study regardless of the number of stacked PEM layers. Phalloidin staining of the cytoskeleton revealed no apparent morphological differences in retinal cells compared with those plated on polystyrene or the larger regions of PEI and PAH; however, cells were relatively more elongated when cultured on the PEM lines. Cell-to-cell communication between cells on adjacent PEM lines was observed as interconnecting tubes containing actin that were a few hundred nanometers in diameter and up to 55 microm in length. This approach provides a simple, fast, and inexpensive method of patterning cells onto micrometer-scale features.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Bauwens2008Control,
    abstract = {{To better understand endogenous parameters that influence pluripotent cell differentiation we used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a model system. We demonstrate that differentiation trajectories in aggregate (embryoid body [EB])-induced differentiation, a common approach to mimic some of the spatial and temporal aspects of in vivo development, are affected by three factors: input hESC composition, input hESC colony size, and EB size. Using a microcontact printing approach, size-specified hESC colonies were formed by plating single-cell suspensions onto micropatterned (MP) extracellular matrix islands. Subsequently, size-controlled EBs were formed by transferring entire colonies into suspension culture enabling the independent investigation of colony and aggregate size effects on differentiation induction. Gene and protein expression analysis of MP-hESC populations revealed that the ratio of Gata6 (endoderm-associated marker) to Pax6 (neural-associated marker) expression increased with decreasing colony size. Moreover, upon forming EBs from these MP-hESCs, we observed that differentiation trajectories were affected by both colony and EB size-influenced parameters. In MP-EBs generated from endoderm-biased (high Gata6/Pax6) input hESCs, higher mesoderm and cardiac induction was observed at larger EB sizes. Conversely, neural-biased (low Gata6/Pax6) input hESCs generated MP-EBs that exhibited higher cardiac induction in smaller EBs. Our analysis demonstrates that heterogeneity in hESC colony and aggregate size, typical in most differentiation strategies, produces subsets of appropriate conditions for differentiation into specific cell types. Moreover, our findings suggest that the local microenvironment modulates endogenous parameters that can be used to influence pluripotent cell differentiation trajectories. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.}},

    abstract = {{In this paper we describe plasma stencilling techniques for patterning 10 mammalian cell lines on hydrophobic and cell repellent poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), methylated glass and bacterial grade polystyrene surfaces. An air plasma produced with a Tesla generator operating at atmospheric pressure was used with microengineered stencils for patterned surface oxidation, selectively transforming the surface to a hydrophilic state to enable cell adhesion and growth. Plasma stencilling obviates the need for directly patterning cell adhesion molecules. Instead, during cell culture, adhesion proteins from the media assemble in a bioactive form on the hydrophilic regions. Critically, the removal of protein patterning prior to cell culture provides the option to also use PDMS–PDMS plasma bonding to incorporate cell patterns within microfluidic systems. Linear patterns were generated using PDMS microchannel stencils, and polyimide stencils with through holes were used for the production of cellular arrays. For the production of smaller cellular arrays, a novel microcapillary-based dielectric barrier discharge system was developed. A numerical method to characterise the cell patterns is also introduced and was used to demonstrate that plasma stencilling is highly effective, with complete patterns confined during long term cell culture (>10 days). In summary, plasma stencilling is simple, rapid, inexpensive, reproducible and a potentially universal cell line patterning capability.

Through this technique, it was possible to place cells in predetermined locations and arrays, separated by defined distances, and to dictate their shape. Limiting the degree of cell extension provided control over cell growth and protein secretion. This method is experimentally simple and highly adaptable. It should be useful for applications in biotechnology that require analysis of individual cells cultured at high density or repeated access to cells placed in specified locations.}},

Confocal microscopy and patch-clamp methods were used to examine excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, and the relation between the plasma membrane calcium current (I Ca) and evoked calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which was visualized as  ” calcium sparks.” The ability of I Ca to trigger calcium release from the SR in both hypertrophied and failing hearts was reduced. Because I Ca density and SR calcium-release channels were normal, the defect appears to reside in a change in the relation between SR calcium-release channels and sarcolemmal calcium channels. β-Adrenergic stimulation largely overcame the defect in hypertrophic but not failing heart cells. Thus, the same defect in EC coupling that develops during hypertrophy may contribute to heart failure when compensatory mechanisms fail.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Klettner2013Regulation,
    abstract = {{The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a major source of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the eye. Despite the role of VEGF in ocular pathology, VEGF is an important factor in maintaining the choroid and the RPE. Accordingly, the VEGF is constitutively expressed in RPE. In this study, the regulation of constitutive VEGF expression was investigated in an RPE/choroid organ culture. To investigate VEGF regulation, RPE/choroid of porcine origin were used. VEGF content was evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The influence of several molecular factors was assessed with commercially available inhibitors (SU1498, bisindolylmaleimide, LY294002, nuclear factor kappaB [NFkB] activation inhibitor, mithramycin, YC-1, Stattic, SB203580). For toxicity measurements of inhibitors, primary RPE cells of porcine origin were used, and toxicity was evaluated with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. VEGF secretion as measured in the RPE/choroid organ culture was diminished after long-term (48 h) inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 by VEGFR-2-antagonist SU1498. VEGF secretion was also diminished after phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase was inhibited by LY294002 for 48 h. Coapplication of the substances did not show an additive effect, suggesting that they use the same pathway in an autocrine-positive VEGF regulation loop. Inhibition of protein kinase C by bisindolylmaleimide, on the other hand, did not influence VEGF secretion in organ culture. Inhibition of the transcription factor SP-1 by mithramycin displayed effects after 24 h and 48 h. Inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and Stat3 did not show any influence on constitutive VEGF secretion. Inhibition of the transcription factor NFkB diminished VEGF secretion after 6 h (earliest measured time point) and remained diminished at all measured time points (24 h, 48 h). The same pattern was found when the inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase p38 was applied. A combination of NFkB and p38 inhibitors displayed an additive effect, completely abolishing VEGF secretion. Constitutive VEGF secretion in the RPE/choroid seems to be regulated by the transcription factor NFkB and the mitogen-activated kinase p38 in an independent manner. Constitutive VEGF secretion may be regulated to a lesser extent by the transcription factor SP-1, while Stat3 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 do not seem to be involved. Additionally, VEGF secretion seems to be regulated long-term by an autocrine positive loop via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase.}},

    abstract = {{Methods and equations for analysing the kinetics of enzyme-catalysed reactions were developed at the beginning of the 20th century in two centres in particular; in Paris, by Victor Henri, and, in Berlin, by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten. Henri made a detailed analysis of the work in this area that had preceded him, and arrived at a correct equation for the initial rate of reaction. However, his approach was open to the important objection that he took no account of the hydrogen-ion concentration (a subject largely undeveloped in his time). In addition, although he wrote down an expression for the initial rate of reaction and described the hyperbolic form of its dependence on the substrate concentration, he did not appreciate the great advantages that would come from analysis in terms of initial rates rather than time courses. Michaelis and Menten not only placed Henri's analysis on a firm experimental foundation, but also defined the experimental protocol that remains standard today. Here, we review this development, and discuss other scientific contributions of these individuals. The three parts have different authors, as indicated, and do not necessarily agree on all details, in particular about the relative importance of the contributions of Michaelis and Menten on the one hand and of Henri on the other. Rather than force the review into an unrealistic consensus, we consider it appropriate to leave the disagreements visible. {\copyright} 2013 FEBS.}},

Z. 49, 333-369] in which they showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex predicted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. Because the original text was written in German yet is often quoted by English-speaking authors, we undertook a complete translation of the 1913 publication, which we provide as Supporting Information . Here we introduce the translation, describe the historical context of the work, and show a new analysis of the original data. In doing so, we uncovered several surprises that reveal an interesting glimpse into the early history of enzymology. In particular, our reanalysis of Michaelis and Menten's data using modern computational methods revealed an unanticipated rigor and precision in the original publication and uncovered a sophisticated, comprehensive analysis that has been overlooked in the century since their work was published. Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition, and derived a single global constant to represent all of their data. That constant was not the Michaelis constant, but rather V(max)/K(m), the specificity constant times the enzyme concentration (k(cat)/K(m) × E(0)).}},

    abstract = {{In situ, cells are highly sensitive to geometrical and mechanical constraints from their microenvironment. These parameters are, however, uncontrolled under classic culture conditions, which are thus highly artefactual. Micro-engineering techniques provide tools to modify the chemical properties of cell culture substrates at sub-cellular scales. These can be used to restrict the location and shape of the substrate regions, in which cells can attach, so-called micropatterns. Recent progress in micropatterning techniques has enabled the control of most of the crucial parameters of the cell microenvironment. Engineered micropatterns can provide a micrometer-scale, soft, 3-dimensional, complex and dynamic microenvironment for individual cells or for multi-cellular arrangements. Although artificial, micropatterned substrates allow the reconstitution of physiological in situ conditions for controlled in vitro cell culture and have been used to reveal fundamental cell morphogenetic processes as highlighted in this review. By manipulating micropattern shapes, cells were shown to precisely adapt their cytoskeleton architecture to the geometry of their microenvironment. Remodelling of actin and microtubule networks participates in the adaptation of the entire cell polarity with respect to external constraints. These modifications further impact cell migration, growth and differentiation.}},

    abstract = {{Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature, is important in tumor growth and metastasis. A key regulator of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has been targeted in numerous anti-angiogenic therapies aimed at inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Systems biology approaches, including computational modeling, are useful for understanding this complex biological process and can aid in the development of novel and effective therapeutics that target the VEGF family of proteins and receptors. We have developed a computational model of VEGF transport and kinetics in the tumor-bearing mouse, which includes three-compartments: normal tissue, blood, and tumor. The model simulates human tumor xenografts and includes human (VEGF121 and VEGF165) and mouse (VEGF120 and VEGF164) isoforms. The model incorporates molecular interactions between these VEGF isoforms and receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2), as well as co-receptors (NRP1 and NRP2). We also include important soluble factors: soluble VEGFR1 (sFlt-1) and α-2-macroglobulin. The model accounts for transport via macromolecular transendothelial permeability, lymphatic flow, and plasma clearance. We have fit the model to available in vivo experimental data on the plasma concentration of free VEGF Trap and VEGF Trap bound to mouse and human VEGF in order to estimate the rates at which parenchymal cells (myocytes and tumor cells) and endothelial cells secrete VEGF. Interestingly, the predicted tumor VEGF secretion rates are significantly lower (0.007-0.023 molecules/cell/s, depending on the tumor microenvironment) than most reported in vitro measurements (0.03-2.65 molecules/cell/s). The optimized model is used to investigate the interstitial and plasma VEGF concentrations and the effect of the VEGF-neutralizing agent, VEGF Trap (aflibercept). This work complements experimental studies performed in mice and provides a framework with which to examine the effects of anti-VEGF agents, aiding in the optimization of such anti-angiogenic therapeutics as well as analysis of clinical data. The model predictions also have implications for biomarker discovery with anti-angiogenic therapies.}},

We also discuss efficient algorithms for encoding the model, and give an example of a simulation of an epithelial sheet. Given the biological flexibility of the model, we propose that it can be used effectively for modeling a range of multicellular processes, such as tumor dynamics and embryogenesis.}},

    abstract = {{Oxidative stress (OS) in the retina plays an important role in the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Our previous work has shown that OS can quantitatively regulate the expression of AP-1 family genes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In this study, we sought to determine whether AP-1 genes can be used as cellular biomarkers of OS to evaluate the efficacy of ascorbate, the major aqueous-phase antioxidant in the blood, in reducing OS in RPE cells in vitro. Human ARPE19 cells were pretreated with increasing levels of ascorbate (0-500 µM) for 3 days which was then removed from the medium. OS was induced 24 h later by the addition of hydrogen peroxide for 1-4 h, to bring the final media concentration of H(2)O(2) to 500 µM. FosB, c-Fos, and ATF3 gene expression was examined from 0 to 24 h after OS. Pretreatment with 200 µM ascorbate maximally reduced the transcriptional OS response of AP-1 genes by up to 87\% after 1 and 4 h, compared to controls. One hundred micromolar of ascorbate provided a statistically significant, but far more modest effect. Ascorbate supplementation of 100-200 µM appears to strongly inhibit OS-induced activation of AP-1 in vitro, but pretreatment with higher levels of ascorbate conferred no additional advantage. These studies suggest that there are optimal levels of antioxidant supplementation to the RPE in vitro. Laboratory assays based upon transcription factor biomarkers may be useful to define beneficial molecular responses to new antioxidants, alternative dosing regimens, and to explore therapeutic efficacy in OS models in vitro.

    abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to characterize the early molecular responses to quantified levels of serial oxidative stress (OS) in the human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Confluent ARPE-19 cells were cultured for 3 days in defined medium to stabilize gene expression. The cells were serially exposed to high levels of OS (500 μM H(2)O(2)) with up to 3 distinct stimuli presented 4 h apart. Gene expression was followed for at least 8 h following initiation of each OS. Using real time qPCR, we quantified the expression of immediate early genes from the AP-1 and EGR transcription factor families and other genes involved in regulating the redox status of the cells. Significant and quantitative changes were seen in the expression of five AP-1 transcription factor genes. The peak level of induced transcription from OS varied from two-fold to >64-fold over the first 4 h, depending on the gene and magnitude of OS. Serial responses were characterized and distinct types of quantifiable OS-specific responses were observed. The responses manifested controlled serial increases in expression of these genes in a manner dependent upon the rate of increase in transcription, the relative duration of the transcriptional stimulus, and the characteristic relaxation to the initial steady state. This complexity suggests a mechanism whereby the rate of increase in transcription directs alternative paths to effect downstream gene-specific responses to OS. The molecular mechanisms by which these signals are transduced and controlled in the RPE are speculative. However, the rapidity of the TF response, and the known autoregulation of TF promoters by their gene products suggests that the early control is likely mediated by phosphorylation and activation of existing AP-1 and EGR protein pools within the cell, modulated by the opposing activity of kinase and phosphatase enzymes. Because of the differences in both initial and serial responses to the input stresses, it appears that control theory may provide a useful characterization of the distinctions.}},

    abstract = {{
                Fluid accumulation into the subretinal space and the development of macular edema is a common condition in age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and following ocular surgery, or injury. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other cytokines have been implicated in the disruption of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) barrier function and a reduction in the regulated removal of subretinal fluid; however, the cellular and molecular events linking these agents to the disruption of barrier function have not been established. In the current study, cultures of ARPE-19 and primary porcine retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells were utilized to investigate the effects of the VEGF-induced modifications to the barrier properties of the RPE. The barrier function was determined by transepithelial resistance (TER) measurements and morphology of the RPE monolayers. In both ARPE-19 and primary porcine RPE cells the administration of VEGF produced a significant drop in TER, and this response was only observed following apical administration. Maximum reduction in TER was reached 5h post VEGF administration. These responses were concentration-dependent with an EC(50) of 502pg/mL in ARPE-19 cells and 251pg/mL in primary porcine cells. In both ARPE-19 and primary RPE cells, the response to VEGF was blocked by pretreatment with the relatively selective VEGF-R2 antagonists, SU5416 or ZM323881, or the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Administration of the relatively selective VEGF-R2 agonist, VEGF-E, also reduced TER in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) of 474pg/mL), while VEGF-R1 agonist, placental growth factor (PlGF), did not significantly alter the TER. Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that confluent monolayers exhibited continuous cell-to-cell ZO-1 protein contacts and apical localization of the VEGF-R2 receptors. These data provide evidence that the VEGF-induced breakdown of RPE barrier function is mediated by the activation of apically-oriented VEGF-R2 receptors. Thus, VEGF-mediated increases in RPE permeability are initiated by a rise in intraocular levels of VEGF.

    abstract = {{The two most commonly used in vitro models of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are fetal human RPE (fhRPE) and ARPE-19 cells; however, studies of their barrier properties have produced contradictory results. To compare their utility as RPE models, their morphologic and functional characteristics were analyzed.
                Monolayers of both cell types were grown on permeable membrane filters. Barrier function and cellular morphology were assessed by transepithelial resistance (TER) measurements and immunohistochemistry. Protein expression was evaluated by immunoblotting and ELISA assays, and retinoid metabolism characterized by HPLC.
                Both cultures developed tight junctions. However, only the fhRPE cells were pigmented, uniform in size and shape, expressed high levels of RPE markers, metabolized all-trans retinal, and developed high TER (>400 Ωcm(2)). The net secretion of pigment-epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) was directed apically in both cultures, but fhRPE cells exhibited secretion rates a thousand-fold greater than in ARPE-19 cells. The net secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was significantly higher in fhRPE cultures and the direction of this secretion was basolateral; while net secretion was apical in ARPE-19 cells. In fresh media, VEGF-E reduced TER in both cultures; however, in conditioned media fhRPE cells did not respond to VEGF-E administration, but retreatment of the conditioned media with anti-PEDF antibodies allowed fhRPE cells to fully respond to VEGF-E.
                Properties of fhRPE cells align with a functionally normal RPE in vivo, while ARPE-19 cells resemble a pathologic or aged RPE. These results suggest a utility for both cell types in understanding distinct, particular aspects of RPE function.}},

Understanding this effect is a critical step in the development of multiplexed high throughput fluidic assays and provides a model for replicating disease states associated with the deterioration of retinal tissue during age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Microcontact printing of fibronectin on polystyrene and glass substrates was used to promote cell attachment, forming RPE patches of controlled size and shape. These colonies mimic the effect of atrophy and loss-of-function that occurs in the retina during degenerative diseases such as AMD. After 72 h of cell growth, levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an important biomarker of AMD, were measured. Cells were counted and morphological indicators of cell viability and tight junction formation were assessed via fluorescence microscopy. Up to a twofold increase of VEGF expression per cell was measured as colony size decreased, suggesting that the local microenvironment of, and connections between, RPE cells influences growth factor expression leading to the initiation and progression of diseases such as AMD.

    abstract = {{Individual-based modelling of biofilms accounts for the fact that individual organisms of the same species may well be in a different physiological state as a result of environmental gradients, lag times in responding to change, or noise in gene expression, which we have become increasingly aware of with the advent of single-cell microbiology. But progress in developing and using individual-based modelling has been hampered by different groups writing their own code and the lack of an available standard model. We therefore set out to merge most features of previous models and incorporate various improvements in order to provide a common basis for further developments. Four improvements stand out: the biofilm pressure field allows for shrinking or consolidating biofilms; the continuous-in-time extracellular polymeric substances excretion leads to more realistic fluid behaviour of the extracellular matrix, avoiding artefacts; the stochastic chemostat mode allows comparison of spatially uniform and heterogeneous systems; and the separation of growth kinetics from the individual cell allows condition-dependent switching of metabolism. As an illustration of the model's use, we used the latter feature to study how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of denitrifying bacteria that induce the denitrification pathway under anoxic or low oxygen conditions. We tested the hypothesis that the existence of these diverse strategies of denitrification can be explained solely by assuming that faster response incurs higher costs. We found that if the ability to switch metabolic pathways quickly incurs no costs the fastest responder is always the best. However, if there is a trade-off where faster switching incurs higher costs, then there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations, suggesting that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different environments. In a single environment, biodiversity of denitrifiers is higher in biofilms than chemostats, higher with than without costs and higher at intermediate frequency of change. The highly modular nature of the new computational model made this case study straightforward to implement, and reflects the sort of novel studies that can easily be executed with the new model. {\copyright} 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.}},
