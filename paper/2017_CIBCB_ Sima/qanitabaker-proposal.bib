    abstract = {{For many years, patient age, axillary lymph node status, tumor size, histological features (especially histological grade and lymphovascular invasion), hormone receptor status, and HER2 status have been the major factors used to categorize patients with breast cancer in order to assess prognosis and determine the appropriate therapy. These factors are most often viewed in combination to group patients into various risk categories. Although these risk categories are useful for assessing prognosis and risk in groups of patients with breast cancer, their role in determining prognosis and evaluating risk in an individual patient is more limited. Therefore, better methods are required to help assess prognosis and determine the most appropriate treatment for patients on an individual basis. Recently, various molecular techniques, particular gene expression profiling, have been increasingly used to help refine breast cancer classification and to assess prognosis and response to therapy. Although the precise role of these newer techniques in the daily management of patients with breast cancer continues to evolve, it is clear that they have the potential to provide value above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical and pathological prognostic and predictive factors.}},

Nevertheless, only a limited number of distinct cell types have been evaluated in this assay to date. Here we report the first large scale comparison of the transcriptional profiles and 3D cell culture phenotypes of a substantial panel of human breast cancer cell lines. Each cell line adopts a colony morphology of one of four main classes in 3D culture. These morphologies reflect, at least in part, the underlying gene expression profile and protein expression patterns of the cell lines, and distinct morphologies were also associated with tumor cell invasiveness and with cell lines originating from metastases. We further demonstrate that consistent differences in genes encoding signal transduction proteins emerge when even tumor cells are cultured in 3D microenvironments.}},

A pathway-based analysis may shed light by projecting candidate genes onto protein functional relationship networks. We are building such a pathway-based analysis system. We have constructed a protein functional interaction network by extending curated pathways with non-curated sources of information, including protein-protein interactions, gene coexpression, protein domain interaction, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and text-mined protein interactions, which cover close to 50\% of the human proteome. By applying this network to two glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) data sets and projecting cancer candidate genes onto the network, we found that the majority of GBM candidate genes form a cluster and are closer than expected by chance, and the majority of GBM samples have sequence-altered genes in two network modules, one mainly comprising genes whose products are localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and another comprising gene products in the nucleus. Both modules are highly enriched in known oncogenes, tumor suppressors and genes involved in signal transduction. Similar network patterns were also found in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. We have built a highly reliable functional interaction network upon expert-curated pathways and applied this network to the analysis of two genome-wide GBM and several other cancer data sets. The network patterns revealed from our results suggest common mechanisms in the cancer biology. Our system should provide a foundation for a network or pathway-based analysis platform for cancer and other diseases.}},

Aberrations and gene expression of EGFR, NF1, and PDGFRA/IDH1 each define the Classical, Mesenchymal, and Proneural subtypes, respectively. Gene signatures of normal brain cell types show a strong relationship between subtypes and different neural lineages. Additionally, response to aggressive therapy differs by subtype, with the greatest benefit in the Classical subtype and no benefit in the Proneural subtype.

    abstract = {{Ovarian cancer remains a significant public health burden, with the highest mortality rate of all the gynecological cancers. This is attributable to the late stage at which the majority of ovarian cancers are diagnosed, coupled with the low and variable response of advanced tumors to standard chemotherapies. To date, clinically useful predictors of treatment response remain lacking. Identifying the genetic determinants of ovarian cancer survival and treatment response is crucial to the development of prognostic biomarkers and personalized therapies that may improve outcomes for the late-stage patients who comprise the majority of cases. To identify constitutional genetic variations contributing to ovarian cancer mortality, we systematically investigated associations between germline polymorphisms and ovarian cancer survival using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA). Using stage-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined >650,000 SNP loci for association with survival. We additionally examined whether the association of significant SNPs with survival was modified by somatic alterations. Germline polymorphisms at rs4934282 (AGAP11/C10orf116) and rs1857623 (DNAH14) were associated with stage-adjusted survival (p= 1.12e-07 and 1.80e-07, FDR q= 1.2e-04 and 2.4e-04, respectively). A third SNP, rs4869 (C10orf116), was additionally identified as significant in the exome sequencing data; it is in near-perfect LD with rs4934282. The associations with survival remained significant when somatic alterations. Discovery analysis of TCGA data reveals germline genetic variations that may play a role in ovarian cancer survival even among late-stage cases. The significant loci are located near genes previously reported as having a possible relationship to platinum and taxol response. Because the variant alleles at the significant loci are common (frequencies for rs4934282 A/C alleles = 0.54/0.46, respectively; rs1857623 A/G alleles = 0.55/0.45, respectively) and germline variants can be assayed noninvasively, our findings provide potential targets for further exploration as prognostic biomarkers and individualized therapies.}},

As a case study, we focused on predicting human hepatotoxicity upon treatment with acetaminophen based on in vitro toxicity data and potential inter-individual variability in gene expression and enzyme activities. By aggregating mechanistic, genome-based in silico cells to a novel 2D liver model and eventually to a whole body model, we predicted pharmacokinetic properties, metabolism, and the onset of hepatotoxicity in an in silico patient. Depending on the concentration of acetaminophen in the liver and the accumulation of toxic metabolites, cell integrity in the liver as a function of space and time as well as changes in the elimination rate of substances were estimated. We show that the variations in elimination rates also influence the distribution of acetaminophen and its metabolites in the whole body. Our results are in agreement with experimental results. What is more, the integrated model also predicted variations in drug toxicity depending on alterations of metabolic enzyme activities. Variations in enzyme activity, in turn, reflect genetic characteristics or diseases of individuals. In conclusion, this framework presents an important basis for efficiently integrating inter-individual variability data into models, paving the way for personalized or stratified predictions of drug toxicity and efficacy.}},

    abstract = {{The human APOBEC3G is an innate restriction factor that, in the absence of Vif, restricts HIV-1 replication by inducing excessive deamination of cytidine residues in nascent reverse transcripts and inhibiting reverse transcription and integration. To shed light on impact of A3G-Vif interactions on HIV replication, we developed a multi-scale computational system consisting of intracellular (single-cell), cellular and extracellular (multicellular) events by using ordinary differential equations. The single-cell model describes molecular-level events within individual cells (such as production and degradation of host and viral proteins, and assembly and release of new virions), whereas the multicellular model describes the viral dynamics and multiple cycles of infection within a population of cells. We estimated the model parameters either directly from previously published experimental data or by running simulations to find the optimum values. We validated our integrated model by reproducing the results of in vitro T cell culture experiments. Crucially, both downstream effects of A3G (hypermutation and reduction of viral burst size) were necessary to replicate the experimental results in silico. We also used the model to study anti-HIV capability of several possible therapeutic strategies including: an antibody to Vif; upregulation of A3G; and mutated forms of A3G. According to our simulations, A3G with a mutated Vif binding site is predicted to be significantly more effective than other molecules at the same dose. Ultimately, we performed sensitivity analysis to identify important model parameters. The results showed that the timing of particle formation and virus release had the highest impacts on HIV replication. The model also predicted that the degradation of A3G by Vif is not a crucial step in HIV pathogenesis. According to UNAIDS (The Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS) and WHO, HIV/AIDS has killed more than 25 million people worldwide since its recognition in 1981. Recently, APOBEC3G, a member of the APOBEC family, has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of HIV infection. In contrast, a viral protein, called Vif, is known to protect the virus by binding to APOBEC3G and causing the degradation of this enzyme. We have developed a computational model to simulate in vitro experiments that include A3G-Vif interactions at the intracellular level and T cell-HIV dynamics at the multicellular level. Experimental data were used to establish system parameters and also to validate predictions of our models. We studied various drugs targeting APOBEC3G and Vif pathways to find the optimum therapeutic approach against HIV replication. Our model predicted that a mutated form of APOBEC3G that does not bind to Vif performs significantly better at suppressing HIV replication compared to other drugs. We also found that the drug should be administered shortly after infection and it must be available to all cells in order to be effective.}},

    abstract = {{The loading conditions used in some current in vivo and in vitro blast-induced neurotrauma models may not be representative of real-world blast conditions. To address these limitations, we developed a compressed-gas driven shock tube with different driven lengths that can generate Friedlander-type blasts. The shock tube can generate overpressures up to 650 kPa with durations between 0.3 and 1.1 ms using compressed helium driver gas, and peak overpressures up to 450 kPa with durations between 0.6 and 3 ms using compressed nitrogen. This device is used for short-duration blast overpressure loading for small animal in vivo injury models, and contrasts the more frequently used long duration/high impulse blast overpressures in the literature. We also developed a new apparatus that is used with the shock tube to recreate the in vivo intracranial overpressure response for loading in vitro culture preparations. The receiver device surrounds the culture with materials of similar impedance to facilitate the propagation of a single overpressure pulse through the tissue. This method prevents pressure waves reflecting off the tissue that can cause unrealistic deformation and injury. The receiver performance was characterized using the longest helium-driven shock tube, and produced in-fluid overpressures up to 1500 kPa at the location where a culture would be placed. This response was well correlated with the overpressure conditions from the shock tube (R(2) = 0.97). Finite element models of the shock tube and receiver were developed and validated to better elucidate the mechanics of this methodology. A demonstration exposing a culture to the loading conditions created by this system suggest tissue strains less than 5\% for all pressure levels simulated, which was well below functional deficit thresholds for strain rates less than 50 s(-1). This novel system is not limited to a specific type of culture model and can be modified to reproduce more complex pressure pulses.}},

While biology is multiscale by nature, project work, and software tools usually focus on isolated aspects of drug action, such as pharmacokinetics at the organism scale or pharmacodynamic interaction on the molecular level. We present a modeling and simulation software platform consisting of PK-Sim(®) and MoBi(®) capable of building and simulating models that integrate across biological scales. A prototypical multiscale model for the progression of a pancreatic tumor and its response to pharmacotherapy is constructed and virtual patients are treated with a prodrug activated by hepatic metabolization. Tumor growth is driven by signal transduction leading to cell cycle transition and proliferation. Free tumor concentrations of the active metabolite inhibit Raf kinase in the signaling cascade and thereby cell cycle progression. In a virtual clinical study, the individual therapeutic outcome of the chemotherapeutic intervention is simulated for a large population with heterogeneous genomic background. Thereby, the platform allows efficient model building and integration of biological knowledge and prior data from all biological scales. Experimental in vitro model systems can be linked with observations in animal experiments and clinical trials. The interplay between patients, diseases, and drugs and topics with high clinical relevance such as the role of pharmacogenomics, drug-drug, or drug-metabolite interactions can be addressed using this mechanistic, insight driven multiscale modeling approach.}},

Predicting the properties and behavior of materials by computer simulation from the bottom-up perspective has long been a vision of computational materials scientists and, as computational power increases, modeling and simulation tools are becoming crucial to the investigation of material systems. The key to achieving this goal is using hierarchies of paradigms that seamlessly connect quantum mechanics to macroscopic systems. Particular progress has been made in relating molecular-scale chemistry to mesoscopic and macroscopic material properties essential to define the materiome. This chapter reviews large-scale atomistic and coarse-grain modeling methods commonly implemented to investigate the properties and behavior of natural and biological materials with nanostructured hierarchies. We present basic concepts of hierarchical multiscale modeling capable of providing a bottom-up description of chemically complex materials and some example applications related to the study of collagen material at different hierarchical levels.}},

The model includes viable and necrotic cell densities, as well as oxygen and glucose concentrations. Viable cells consume nutrients and become necrotic below critical nutrient concentrations. Proliferation of viable cells is contact-inhibited if the total cellular density locally exceeds volume carrying capacity. The model is discussed under the assumption of spherical symmetry. Unknown model parameters are determined by simultaneously fitting the cell number to several experimental growth curves for different nutrient concentrations. The outcome of the PDE model is compared with an analogous off-lattice agent-based model for tumour growth. It turns out that the numerically more efficient PDE model suffices to explain the macroscopic growth data. As in the agent-based model, we find that the experimental growth curves are only reproduced when a necrotic core develops.

Applications of systems concepts at the mammalian genome level are quite challenging, and new complimentary computational/experimental techniques are being introduced. Most recent work applying modern systems biology techniques has been conducted on bacteria, yeast, mouse, and human genomes. However, these concepts and tools are equally applicable to other species including ruminants (e.g., livestock). In systems biology, both bottom-up and top-down approaches are central to assemble information from all levels of biological pathways that must coordinate physiological processes. A bottom-up approach encompasses draft reconstruction, manual curation, network reconstruction through mathematical methods, and validation of these models through literature analysis (i.e., bibliomics). Whereas top-down approach encompasses metabolic network reconstructions using 'omics' data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) generated through DNA microarrays, RNA-Seq or other modern high-throughput genomic techniques using appropriate statistical and bioinformatics methodologies. In this review we focus on top-down approach as a means to improve our knowledge of underlying metabolic processes in ruminants in the context of nutrition. We also explore the usefulness of tissue specific reconstructions (e.g., liver and adipose tissue) in cattle as a means to enhance productive efficiency.}},

    abstract = {{We propose a cellular automaton model of solid tumour growth, in which each cell is equipped with a micro-environment response network. This network is modelled using a feed-forward artificial neural network, that takes environmental variables as an input and from these determines the cellular behaviour as the output. The response of the network is determined by connection weights and thresholds in the network, which are subject to mutations when the cells divide. As both available space and nutrients are limited resources for the tumour, this gives rise to clonal evolution where only the fittest cells survive. Using this approach we have investigated the impact of the tissue oxygen concentration on the growth and evolutionary dynamics of the tumour. The results show that the oxygen concentration affects the selection pressure, cell population diversity and morphology of the tumour. A low oxygen concentration in the tissue gives rise to a tumour with a fingered morphology that contains aggressive phenotypes with a small apoptotic potential, while a high oxygen concentration in the tissue gives rise to a tumour with a round morphology containing less evolved phenotypes. The tissue oxygen concentration thus affects the tumour at both the morphological level and on the phenotype level.}},

We develop in this paper a hybrid cellular automata model that combines the differential nutrient transport equation to investigate the nutrient limited cell construct development for cartilage tissue engineering. Individual cell behaviors of migration, contact inhibition and cell collision, coupled with the cell proliferation regulated by oxygen concentration were carefully studied. Simplified two-dimensional simulations were performed. Using this model, we investigated the influence of cell migration speed on the overall cell growth within in vitro cell scaffolds. It was found that intense cell motility can enhance initial cell growth rates. However, since cell growth is also significantly modulated by the nutrient contents, intense cell motility with conventional uniform cell seeding method may lead to declined cell growth in the final time because concentrated cell population has been growing around the scaffold periphery to block the nutrient transport from outside culture media. Therefore, homogeneous cell seeding may not be a good way of gaining large and uniform cell densities for the final results. We then compared cell growth in scaffolds with various seeding modes, and proposed a seeding mode with cells initially residing in the middle area of the scaffold that may efficiently reduce the nutrient blockage and result in a better cell amount and uniform cell distribution for tissue engineering construct developments.}},

    abstract = {{Tumor spheroids grown in vitro have been widely used as models of in vivo tumor growth because they display many of the characteristics of in vivo growth, including the effects of nutrient limitations and perhaps the effect of stress on growth. In either case there are numerous biochemical and biophysical processes involved whose interactions can only be understood via a detailed mathematical model. Previous models have focused on either a continuum description or a cell-based description, but both have limitations. In this paper we propose a new mathematical model of tumor spheroid growth that incorporates both continuum and cell-level descriptions, and thereby retains the advantages of each while circumventing some of their disadvantages. In this model the cell-based description is used in the region where the majority of growth and cell division occurs, at the periphery of a tumor, while a continuum description is used for the quiescent and necrotic zones of the tumor and for the extracellular matrix. Reaction-diffusion equations describe the transport and consumption of two important nutrients, oxygen and glucose, throughout the entire domain. The cell-based component of this hybrid model allows us to examine the effects of cell\^{a}cell adhesion and variable growth rates at the cellular level rather than at the continuum level. We show that the model can predict a number of cellular behaviors that have been observed experimentally.}},

    abstract = {{In this paper, we review multi-scale models of solid tumour growth and discuss a middle-out framework that tracks individual cells. By focusing on the cellular dynamics of a healthy colorectal crypt and its invasion by mutant, cancerous cells, we compare a cell-centre, a cell-vertex and a continuum model of cell proliferation and movement. All models reproduce the basic features of a healthy crypt: cells proliferate near the crypt base, they migrate upwards and are sloughed off near the top. The models are used to establish conditions under which mutant cells are able to colonize the crypt either by top-down or by bottom-up invasion. While the continuum model is quicker and easier to implement, it can be difficult to relate system parameters to measurable biophysical quantities. Conversely, the greater detail inherent in the multi-scale models means that experimentally derived parameters can be incorporated and, therefore, these models offer greater scope for understanding normal and diseased crypts, for testing and identifying new therapeutic targets and for predicting their impacts.}},

The multiscale nature of cancer requires mathematical modeling approaches that can handle multiple intracellular and extracellular factors acting on different time and space scales. Hybrid models provide a way to integrate both discrete and continuous variables that are used to represent individual cells and concentration or density fields, respectively. Each discrete cell can also be equipped with submodels that drive cell behavior in response to microenvironmental cues. Moreover, the individual cells can interact with one another to form and act as an integrated tissue. Hybrid models form part of a larger class of individual-based models that can naturally connect with tumor cell biology and allow for the integration of multiple interacting variables both intrinsically and extrinsically and are therefore perfectly suited to a systems biology approach to tumor growth.}},

    abstract = {{In this paper we present a hybrid mathematical model of the invasion of healthy tissue by a solid tumour. In particular we consider early vascular growth, just after angiogenesis has occurred. We examine how the geometry of the growing tumour is affected by tumour cell heterogeneity caused by genetic mutations. As the tumour grows, mutations occur leading to a heterogeneous tumour cell population with some cells having a greater ability to migrate, proliferate or degrade the surrounding tissue. All of these cell properties are closely controlled by cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions and as such the physical geometry of the whole tumour will be dependent on these individual cell interactions. The hybrid model we develop focuses on four key variables implicated in the invasion process: tumour cells, host tissue (extracellular matrix), matrix-degradative enzymes and oxygen. The model is considered to be hybrid since the latter three variables are continuous (i.e. concentrations) and the tumour cells are discrete (i.e. individuals). With this hybrid model we examine how individual-based cell interactions (with one another and the matrix) can affect the tumour shape and discuss which of these interactions is perhaps most crucial in influencing the tumour's final structure.}},

Here we describe how an agent-based or dynamic cellular automata (DCA) approach can be used as a very simple, yet very general method to model many different kinds of cellular or biochemical processes. Specifically, using simple pairwise interaction rules coupled with random object moves to simulate Brownian motion, we show how the DCA approach can be used to easily and accurately model diffusion, viscous drag, enzyme rate processes, metabolism (the Kreb's cycle), and complex genetic circuits (the repressilator). We also demonstrate how DCA approaches are able to accurately capture the stochasticity of many biological processes. The success and simplicity of this technique suggests that many other physical properties and significantly more complicated aspects of cellular behavior could be modeled using DCA methods. An easy-to-use, graphically-based computer program, called SimCell, was developed to perform the DCA simulations described here. It is available at http://wishart.biology.ualberta.ca/SimCell/.}},

In this approach, model development starts with construction of the most basic mathematical model--typically consisting of predetermined or newly-elucidated biological behavior motifs--capable of reproducing desired biological behaviors. From this point, mechanistic detail is added incrementally and systematically, and the effects of each addition are evaluated. This approach follows the typical progression of experimental data availability in that higher-order, lumped measurements are often more prevalent initially than specific, mechanistic ones. It also necessarily provides the modeler with insight into the structural requirements and performance capabilities of the resulting detailed mechanistic model, which facilitates further analysis. The top-down approach to mechanistic modeling identified three such requirements and a branched dependency-degradation competition motif critical for the scFv folding model to reproduce experimentally observed scFv folding dependencies on BiP and PDI and increased production when both species are overexpressed and promoted straightforward prediction of parameter dependencies. It also prescribed modification of the guiding hypothesis to capture BiP and PDI synergy.}},

    abstract = {{The hope of the rapid translation of 'genes to drugs' has foundered on the reality that disease biology is complex, and that drug development must be driven by insights into biological responses. Systems biology aims to describe and to understand the operation of complex biological systems and ultimately to develop predictive models of human disease. Although meaningful molecular level models of human cell and tissue function are a distant goal, systems biology efforts are already influencing drug discovery. Large-scale gene, protein and metabolite measurements ('omics') dramatically accelerate hypothesis generation and testing in disease models. Computer simulations integrating knowledge of organ and system-level responses help prioritize targets and design clinical trials. Automation of complex primary human cell-based assay systems designed to capture emergent properties can now integrate a broad range of disease-relevant human biology into the drug discovery process, informing target and compound validation, lead optimization, and clinical indication selection. These systems biology approaches promise to improve decision making in pharmaceutical development.}},

By discovering how function arises in dynamic interactions, systems biology addresses the missing links between molecules and physiology. Top-down systems biology identifies molecular interaction networks on the basis of correlated molecular behavior observed in genome-wide "omics" studies. Bottom-up systems biology examines the mechanisms through which functional properties arise in the interactions of known components.

Therefore the study of biological functions is greatly aided by multi-scale methods that enable the coupling and simulation of models spanning several spatial and temporal scales.

    abstract = {{Modeling is essential to integrating knowledge of human physiology. Comprehensive self-consistent descriptions expressed in quantitative mathematical form define working hypotheses in testable and reproducible form, and though such models are always "wrong" in the sense of being incomplete or partly incorrect, they provide a means of understanding a system and improving that understanding. Physiological systems, and models of them, encompass different levels of complexity. The lowest levels concern gene signaling and the regulation of transcription and translation, then biophysical and biochemical events at the protein level, and extend through the levels of cells, tissues and organs all the way to descriptions of integrated systems behavior. The highest levels of organization represent the dynamically varying interactions of billions of cells. Models of such systems are necessarily simplified to minimize computation and to emphasize the key factors defining system behavior; different model forms are thus often used to represent a system in different ways. Each simplification of lower level complicated function reduces the range of accurate operability at the higher level model, reducing robustness, the ability to respond correctly to dynamic changes in conditions. When conditions change so that the complexity reduction has resulted in the solution departing from the range of validity, detecting the deviation is critical, and requires special methods to enforce adapting the model formulation to alternative reduced-form modules or decomposing the reduced-form aggregates to the more detailed lower level modules to maintain appropriate behavior. The processes of error recognition, and of mapping between different levels of model complexity and shifting the levels of complexity of models in response to changing conditions, are essential for adaptive modeling and computer simulation of large-scale systems in reasonable time.}},

In this review, we formulate a definition of multi-scale in terms of levels of biological organisation and describe the types of model that are found at each level. Key issues that arise in trying to formulate and solve multi-scale and multi-physics models are considered and examples of how these issues have been addressed are given for two of the more mature fields in computational biology: the molecular dynamics of ion channels and cardiac modelling. As even more complex models are developed over the coming few years, it will be necessary to develop new methods to model them (in particular in coupling across the interface between stochastic and deterministic processes) and new techniques will be required to compute their solutions efficiently on massively parallel computers. We outline how we envisage these developments occurring.}},

We present here a detailed description of the model, and use successive mean-field approximations to connect it to more coarse-grained approaches, such as discrete cell-based algorithms and coupled partial differential equations. We also discuss efficient algorithms for encoding the model, and give an example of a simulation of an epithelial sheet.

    abstract = {{Agent-based modeling (ABM) is an in silico technique that is being used in a variety of research areas such as in social sciences, economics and increasingly in biomedicine as an interdisciplinary tool to study the dynamics of complex systems. Here, we describe its applicability to integrative tumor biology research by introducing a multi-scale tumor modeling platform that understands brain cancer as a complex dynamic biosystem. We summarize significant findings of this work, and discuss both challenges and future directions for ABM in the field of cancer research.}},
