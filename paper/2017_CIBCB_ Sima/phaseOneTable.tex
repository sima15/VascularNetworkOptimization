 \caption{\textbf{Self-organizing Network}: (a) is the initial conditions with fixed circulatory cells (blue) on each side and vascular (red) and supported cells (yellow) randomly mixed; (b) is the steady state network following self organization; (c) is the distribution of chemoattractant during vessel formation and (d) is at a steady state. In all images of biochemical distribution, blue signifies a low concentration, while red signifies a high concentration.}
