    abstract = {{The N-end rule relates the regulation of the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue. Degradation signals (degrons) that are targeted by the N-end rule pathway include a set called N-degrons. The main determinant of an N-degron is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein. In eukaryotes, the N-end rule pathway is a part of the ubiquitin system and consists of two branches, the Ac/N-end rule and the Arg/N-end rule pathways. The Ac/N-end rule pathway targets proteins containing N(α) -terminally acetylated (Nt-acetylated) residues. The Arg/N-end rule pathway recognizes unacetylated N-terminal residues and involves N-terminal arginylation. Together, these branches target for degradation a majority of cellular proteins. For example, more than 80\% of human proteins are cotranslationally Nt-acetylated. Thus most proteins harbor a specific degradation signal, termed (Ac)N-degron, from the moment of their birth. Specific N-end rule pathways are also present in prokaryotes and in mitochondria. Enzymes that produce N-degrons include methionine-aminopeptidases, caspases, calpains, Nt-acetylases, Nt-amidases, arginyl-transferases and leucyl-transferases. Regulated degradation of specific proteins by the N-end rule pathway mediates a legion of physiological functions, including the sensing of heme, oxygen, and nitric oxide; selective elimination of misfolded proteins; the regulation of DNA repair, segregation and condensation; the signaling by G proteins; the regulation of peptide import, fat metabolism, viral and bacterial infections, apoptosis, meiosis, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiovascular development; and the functioning of adult organs, including the pancreas and the brain. Discovered 25 years ago, this pathway continues to be a fount of biological insights.}},

    abstract = {{Chronic inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) observed in exudative form of AMD results in vision loss. Human retinal pigment epithelial cell (HRPE) layer and choroidal tissue are the primary pathological sites in AMD. Pathological and therapeutic evidences have strongly indicated the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) molecules as critical components in CNV pathogenesis. In these studies, we used human primary HRPE and choroidal fibroblast cells (HCHF) prepared from adult donor eyes. The effects of inflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ + TNF-α + IL-1β) mix (ICM) on global gene expression profiles in HRPE cells, revealed 10- and 9-fold increase in VEGF-A and VEGF-C expression, respectively. The microarray results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR and secretion of VEGFs proteins. IL-1β is the most potent in inducing VEGFs secretion followed by IFN-γ and TNF-α, and the secretion was more effective in the presence of 2 and 3 cytokines. NF-κB and JAK-STAT pathway, but not HIF-1α, Sp-1, Sp-3, and STAT-3, transcription factors were upregulated and translocated to nucleus by ICM treatment. The mRNA levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-C and secretion of these proteins were also significantly enhanced by ICM in HCHF cells. The secretion of other angiogenic molecules, PEDF, SDF-1α, endostatin, and angiopoietins was not affected by ICM. Our results show that the inflammatory cytokines enhance secretion of VEGF-A and VEGF-C by HRPE and HCHF cells. These studies indicate that VEGFs secreted by these cells initiate and promote pathological choroidal and retinal noevascularization processes in AMD. J. Cell.

@article{Jarrett2012Consequences,
    abstract = {{The retina resides in an environment that is primed for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and resultant oxidative damage. The retina is one of the highest oxygen-consuming tissues in the human body. The highest oxygen levels are found in the choroid, but this falls dramatically across the outermost retina, creating a large gradient of oxygen towards the retina and inner segments of the photoreceptors which contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This micro-environment together with abundant photosensitizers, visible light exposure and a high energy demand supports a highly oxidative milieu. However, oxidative damage is normally minimized by the presence of a range of antioxidant and efficient repair systems. Unfortunately, as we age oxidative damage increases, antioxidant capacity decreases and the efficiency of reparative systems become impaired. The result is retinal dysfunction and cell loss leading to visual impairment. It appears that these age-related oxidative changes are a hallmark of early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which, in combination with hereditary susceptibility and other retinal modifiers, can progress to the pathology and visual morbidity associated with advanced AMD. This review reassesses the consequences of oxidative stress in AMD and strategies for preventing or reversing oxidative damage in retinal tissues. Copyright {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-scale and multi-class models offer unique advantages for biological systems. Computational modeling has significantly impacted our ability to analyze vast (and exponentially increasing) quantities of experimental data for a variety of applications, such as drug discovery and disease forecasting. Single-scale, single-class models persist as the most common group of models, but biological complexity often demands more sophisticated approaches. This review surveys modeling approaches that are multi-class (incorporating multiple model types) and/or multi-scale (accounting for multiple spatial or temporal scales) and describes how these models, and combinations thereof, should be used within the context of the problem statement. We end by highlighting agent-based models as an intuitive, modular, and flexible framework within which multi-scale and multi-class models can be implemented. }},

Single-use disposable technologies in the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals
Advantages and limitations of single-use manufacturing
Single-use systems for protein drug substance production process: key features, current scales and vendors
Disposables reduce cost of clinical manufacturing and co-locating manufacturing.
The manufacture of protein biopharmaceuticals is conducted under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) and involves multiple unit operations for upstream production and downstream purification. Until recently, production facilities relied on the use of relatively inflexible, hard-piped equipment including large stainless steel bioreactors and tanks to hold product intermediates and buffers. However, there is an increasing trend towards the adoption of single-use technologies across the manufacturing process. Technical advances have now made an end-to-end single-use manufacturing facility possible, but several aspects of single-use technology require further improvement and are continually evolving. This article provides a perspective on the current state-of-the-art in single-use technologies and highlights trends that will improve performance and increase the market penetration of disposable manufacturing in the future.

@article{AnnaMaria2003Limiting,
    abstract = {{Fed-batch production of recombinant beta-galactosidase in E. coli was studied with respect to the specific growth rate at induction. The cultivations were designed to induce protein production by IPTG at a glucose feed rate corresponding to high mu = 0.5 h(-1)) or low (mu = 0.1 h(-1)) specific growth rate. Protein production rate was approximately 100\% higher at the higher specific growth rate, resulting in the accumulation of beta-galactosidase up to 30\% of the total cell protein. Transcription analysis showed that beta-galactosidase-specific messenger RNA was immediately formed after induction (<5 min), but the amount was the same in both cases and was thus not the initial limiting factor. The content of ribosomes, as represented by rRNA, rapidly decreased with specific growth rate from a relative level of 100\%, at the high specific growth rate, to 20\% at the low specific growth rate. At high specific growth rate, ribosomes were additionally degraded upon induction due to the high production level. Translation therefore seemed to be the initial limiting factor of the protein synthesis capacity. The alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate increased at both high and low feed level inductions, indicating an induction-forced starvation of charged tRNA and/or glucose. The altered physiological status was also detected by the formation of acetic acid. However, the higher production rate resulted in high-level accumulation of acetic acid, which was absent at low feed rate production. Acetic acid production is thus coupled to the high product formation rate and is proposed to be due either to a precursor drain of Krebs cycle intermediates and a time lag before induction of the glyoxalate shunt, or to single amino acid overflow, since the model product is relatively poor in glycin and alanin. In conclusion, it is proposed that production at high specific growth rate becomes precursor-limited, while production at low specific growth rate is carbon- and/or energy-limited.

This was designed to supplement the previous findings from the batch experiment, in which ethanol was added artificially and no substrate components were limiting the metabolism of the same yeast, that μ = μ0e −k 1p and ν = ν0e −k 2p, where k1 and k2 are empirical constants and subscript the 0 denotes respective values at p = 0. The effects of p on the values of μ and ν were confirmed by the Lineweaver-Burk plot to belong to noncompetitive inhibition. The formulas here for μ and ν as affected by p, if extrapolated to the case of no limiting substrates, were in good agreement in respective forms with those derived previously from the batch experiment, though the values of corresponding coefficients in these formulas were different. The differential equations for μ and ν as functions of both p and S and, in addition for the rate of glucose consumption as correlated by the yield factors either with the cell growth rate or the rate of ethanol production, were solved properly with a digital computer.

    abstract = {{Many optimal control problems are characterized by their multiple performance measures that are often noncommensurable and competing with each other. The presence of multiple objectives in a problem usually give rise to a set of optimal solutions, largely known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Evolutionary algorithms have been recognized to be well suited for multi-objective optimization because of their capability to evolve a set of nondominated solutions distributed along the Pareto front. This has led to the development of many evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms among which Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA and its enhanced version NSGA-II) has been found effective in solving a wide variety of problems. Recently, we reported a genetic algorithm based technique for solving dynamic single-objective optimization problems, with single as well as multiple control variables, that appear in fed-batch bioreactor applications. The purpose of this study is to extend this methodology for solution of multi-objective optimal control problems under the framework of NSGA-II. The applicability of the technique is illustrated by solving two optimal control problems, taken from literature, which have usually been solved by several methods as single-objective dynamic optimization problems.}},

As a general approach, tissue engineering of skin, bone and cartilage using cell transplantation on biodegradable matrices has achieved great success. However, such techniques encounter difficulties when applied to complex tissues and vital organs. The principal limitation for such applications is the lack of an intrinsic blood supply for the tissue engineered organ, which experiences significant cell death when the tissue thickness is increased above the 1--2 mm range. In this work, the concept of microfabricated scaffolds is introduced, with the goal of producing organ templates with feature resolution of 1 micron, well in excess of that necessary to fashion the capillaries which comprise the microcirculation of the organ. Initial efforts have resulted in high resolution biocompatible polymer scaffolds produced by replica molding from silicon micromachined template wafers. These scaffolds have been successfully seeded with endothelial cells in channels with dimensions as small as the capillaries.}},

Here we describe a simple, nonintegrating strategy for reprogramming cell fate based on administration of synthetic mRNA modified to overcome innate antiviral responses. We show that this approach can reprogram multiple human cell types to pluripotency with efficiencies that greatly surpass established protocols.

A need exists for a computational model that allows for flow through tissues dense in nonpercolating and possibly nonperfusable microvessels to be efficiently evaluated. A finite difference (FD) model based on Poiseuille flow through a distribution of straight tubes acting as point sources and sinks, and Darcy flow through the interstitium, was developed to describe fluid flow through a tissue containing engineered microvessels. Accuracy of the FD model was assessed by comparison to a finite element (FE) model for the case of a single tube. Because the case of interest is a tissue with microvessels aligned with the flow, accuracy was also assessed in depth for a corresponding 2D FD model. The potential utility of the 2D FD model was then explored by correlating metrics of flow through the model tissue to microvessel morphometric properties. The results indicate that the model can predict the density of perfused microvessels based on parameters that can be easily measured.}},

@article{ODea2015Multiscale,
    abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the derivation of macroscopic equations appropriate to describe the growth of biological tissue, employing a multiple-scale homogenization method to accommodate explicitly the influence of the underlying microscale structure of the material, and its evolution, on the macroscale dynamics. Such methods have been widely used to study porous and poroelastic materials; however, a distinguishing feature of biological tissue is its ability to remodel continuously in response to local environmental cues. Here, we present the derivation of a model broadly applicable to tissue engineering applications, characterized by cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition in porous scaffolds used within tissue culture systems, which we use to study coupling between fluid flow, nutrient transport, and microscale tissue growth. Attention is restricted to surface accretion within a rigid porous medium saturated with a Newtonian fluid; coupling between the various dynamics is achieved by specifying the rate of microscale growth to be dependent upon the uptake of a generic diffusible nutrient. The resulting macroscale model comprises a Darcy-type equation governing fluid flow, with flow characteristics dictated by the assumed periodic microstructure and surface growth rate of the porous medium, coupled to an advection–reaction equation specifying the nutrient concentration. Illustrative numerical simulations are presented to indicate the influence of microscale growth on macroscale dynamics, and to highlight the importance of including experimentally relevant microstructural information to correctly determine flow dynamics and nutrient delivery in tissue engineering applications.}},

This model can quantitatively describe the start-up of the system by coupling a model for studying the population dynamics of the granules in the reactor (reactor-scale model) and a model for studying the microbial community structure in the granules (granule-scale model). The reactor-scale model is used for simulation for 10 days from the start, during which the granule size is relatively small; the granule-scale model is used after Day 10. The present approach proposes the output data of the reactor-scale model after 10 days as initial conditions for the granule-scale model. The constructed model satisfactorily describes experimental data in various spatial and temporal scales, which were obtained in this study by performing the anaerobic-aerobic-anoxic cycles using a sequencing batch reactor. Simulations using this model quantitatively predicted that the stability of nutrient removal process depended largely on the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and the DO setpoint adaptation could improve the nutrient removal performance. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

    abstract = {{Cell types are defined at the molecular level during embryogenesis by a process called pattern formation and created by the selective utilization of combinations of sequence specific transcription factors. Developmental programs define the sets of genes that are available to each particular cell type, and real-time biochemical signaling interactions define the extent to which these sets are used at any given time and place. Gene expression is regulated through the integrated action of many cis-regulatory elements, including core promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators. The chromatin state in developing body parts provides a code to cellular populations that direct their cell fates. Chromatin profiling has been a method of choice for mapping regulatory sequences in cells that go through developmental transitions. We used antibodies against histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylations (H3K4me3) a modification associated with promoters and open/active chromatin, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylations (H3K27me3) associated with Polycomb-repressed regions and RNA polymerase II (Pol2) associated with transcriptional initiation to identify the chromatin state signature of the mouse forelimb during mid-gestation, at embryonic day 12 (E12). The families of genes marked included those related to transcriptional regulation and embryogenesis. One third of the marked genes were transcriptionally active while only a small fraction were bivalent marked. Sequence specific transcription factors that were activated were involved in cell specification including bone and muscle formation. Our results demonstrate that embryonic limb cells do not exhibit the plasticity of the ES cells but are rather programmed for a finer tuning for cell lineage specification.}},

The chooser method uses an entropy-based approach to propose an additional perturbation experiment to discriminate among the set of hypothetical networks determined by the predictor. These methods may be used iteratively and interactively to successively refine the genetic network: at each iteration, the perturbation selected by the chooser is experimentally performed to generate a new gene expression profile, and the predictor is used to derive a refined set of hypothetical gene networks using the cumulative expression data. Performance of the predictor and chooser is evaluated on simulated networks with varying number of genes and number of interactions per gene. 1}},

This ill-posed inverse problem, which is of crucial importance across practically all areas of biology, is solved by using Karnaugh maps which are classical tools for digital system design. It is shown that the incorporation of prior knowledge, presented in the form of biological pathways, can bring about a dramatic reduction in the cardinality of the network search space. Constraining the connectivity of the network, the number and relative importance of the attractors, and concordance with observed time-course data are additional factors that can be used to further reduce the cardinality of the search space. The networks produced by the approaches developed here should facilitate the understanding of multivariate biological phenomena and the subsequent design of intervention approaches that are more likely to be successful in practice. As an example, the results of this paper are applied to the widely studied p53 pathway and it is shown that the resulting network exhibits dynamic behavior consistent with experimental observations from the published literature.}},

In this study, we address the dynamics of growth factor signaling through profiling of protein phosphorylation and gene expression, demonstrating the presence of a kinetically defined cluster of delayed early genes that function to attenuate the early events of growth factor signaling. Using epidermal growth factor receptor signaling as the major model system and concentrating on regulation of transcription and mRNA stability, we demonstrate that a number of genes within the delayed early gene cluster function as feedback regulators of immediate early genes. Consistent with their role in negative regulation of cell signaling, genes within this cluster are downregulated in diverse tumor types, in correlation with clinical outcome. More generally, our study proposes a mechanistic description of the cellular response to growth factors by defining architectural motifs that underlie the function of signaling networks.}},

The latter approach is especially useful in situations when gene expression measurements are noisy and may lead to inconsistent observations. We propose simple efficient algorithms that can be used to answer the Consistency Problem and find one or all consistent Boolean networks relative to the given examples. The same method is extended to learning gene regulatory networks under the Best-Fit Extension paradigm. We also introduce a simple and fast way of finding all Boolean networks having limited error size in the Best-Fit Extension Problem setting.

We have considered a learning strategy that is well suited for situations in which inconsistencies in observations are likely to occur. This strategy produces a Boolean network that makes as few misclassifications as possible and is a generalization of the well-known Consistency Problem. We have focused on the computational complexity of this problem. It turns out that for many function classes, the Best-Fit Extension Problem for Boolean networks is polynomial-time solvable, including those networks having bounded indegree and those in which no assumptions whatsoever about the functions are made. This promising result provides motivation for developing efficient algorithms for inferring network structures from gene expression data.}},

@article{Akutsu1999Identification,
    abstract = {{Liang, Fuhrman and Somogyi (PSB98, 18-29, 1998) have described an algorithm for inferring genetic network architectures from state transition tables which correspond to time series of gene expression patterns, using the Boolean network model. Their results of computational experiments suggested that a small number of state transition (INPUT/OUTPUT) pairs are sufficient in order to infer the original Boolean network correctly. This paper gives a mathematical proof for their observation. Precisely, this paper devises a much simpler algorithm for the same problem and proves that, if the indegree of each node (i.e., the number of input nodes to each node) is bounded by a constant, only O(log n) state transition pairs (from 2n pairs) are necessary and sufficient to identify the original Boolean network of n nodes correctly with high probability. We made computational experiments in order to expose the constant factor involved in O(log n) notation. The computational results show that the Boolean network of size 100,000 can be identified by our algorithm from about 100 INPUT/OUTPUT pairs if the maximum indegree is bounded by 2. It is also a merit of our algorithm that the algorithm is conceptually so simple that it is extensible for more realistic network models.}},

For example, they represent a mechanism capable of stabilizing chaotic behavior in Boolean network models of discrete dynamical systems. When comparing the class of canalizing functions to other classes of functions with respect to their evolutionary plausibility as emergent control rules in genetic regulatory systems, it is informative to know the number of canalizing functions with a given number of input variables. This is also important in the context of using the class of canalizing functions as a constraint during the inference of genetic networks from gene expression data. To this end, we derive an exact formula for the number of canalizing Boolean functions of n variables. We also derive a formula for the probability that a random Boolean function is canalizing for any given bias p of taking the value 1. In addition, we consider the number and probability of Boolean functions that are canalizing for exactly k variables. Finally, we provide an algorithm for randomly generating canalizing functions with a given bias p and any number of variables, which is needed for Monte Carlo simulations of Boolean networks.}},

The advances described here allow us to define some significant relationships between the set-complexity measure and the structure of graphs, and of their component sub-graphs. We show here that modular graph structures tend to maximize the set-complexity of graphs. We point out the relationship between modularity and redundancy, and discuss the significance of set-complexity in this regard. We specifically discuss the relationship between complexity and entropy in the case of complete-bipartite graphs, and present a new method for constructing highly complex, binary graphs. These results can be extended to the case of ternary graphs, and to other multi-edge graphs, which are fundamentally more relevant to biological structures and systems. Finally, our results lead us to an approach for extracting high complexity modular graphs from large, noisy graphs with low information content. We illustrate this approach with two examples.}},

Recent advances in data collection and analysis2, 11, 12, however, are generating unprecedented amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand these complex wiring diagrams1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks2. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli 3, 6. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks.}},

    abstract = {{Robust temporal and spatial patterns of cell types emerge in the course of normal development in multicellular organisms. The onset of degenerative diseases may result from altered cell fate decisions that give rise to pathological phenotypes. Complex networks of genetic and non-genetic components underlie such normal and altered morphogenetic patterns. Here we focus on the networks of regulatory interactions involved in cell-fate decisions. Such networks modeled as dynamical non-linear systems attain particular stable configurations on gene activity that have been interpreted as cell-fate states. The network structure also restricts the most probable transition patterns among such states. The so-called Epigenetic Landscape (EL), originally proposed by C. H. Waddington, was an early attempt to conceptually explain the emergence of developmental choices as the result of intrinsic constraints (regulatory interactions) shaped during evolution. Thanks to the wealth of molecular genetic and genomic studies, we are now able to postulate gene regulatory networks (GRN) grounded on experimental data, and to derive EL models for specific cases. This, in turn, has motivated several mathematical and computational modeling approaches inspired by the EL concept, that may be useful tools to understand and predict cell-fate decisions and emerging patterns. In order to distinguish between the classical metaphorical EL proposal of Waddington, we refer to the Epigenetic Attractors Landscape (EAL), a proposal that is formally framed in the context of GRNs and dynamical systems theory. In this review we discuss recent EAL modeling strategies, their conceptual basis and their application in studying the emergence of both normal and pathological developmental processes. In addition, we discuss how model predictions can shed light into rational strategies for cell fate regulation, and we point to challenges ahead.}},

    abstract = {{Cell fate reprogramming, such as the generation of insulin-producing β cells from other pancreas cells, can be achieved by external modulation of key transcription factors. However, the known gene regulatory interactions that form a complex network with multiple feedback loops make it increasingly difficult to design the cell reprogramming scheme because the linear regulatory pathways as schemes of causal influences upon cell lineages are inadequate for predicting the effect of transcriptional perturbation. However, sufficient information on regulatory networks is usually not available for detailed formal models. Here we demonstrate that by using the qualitatively described regulatory interactions as the basis for a coarse-grained dynamical ODE (ordinary differential equation) based model, it is possible to recapitulate the observed attractors of the exocrine and β, δ, α endocrine cells and to predict which gene perturbation can result in desired lineage reprogramming. Our model indicates that the constraints imposed by the incompletely elucidated regulatory network architecture suffice to build a predictive model for making informed decisions in choosing the set of transcription factors that need to be modulated for fate reprogramming.}},

However, how does the metazoan body itself ?program? the various cell lineages in the first place? Knowledge of how multipotent cells make cell-fate decisions and commit to a particular lineage is crucial for a rational reprogramming strategy and to avoid trial-and-error approaches in choosing the appropriate set of transcription factors to use. In the past few years, a general principle has emerged in which small gene circuits of cross-inhibition and self-activation govern the decision at branch points of cell development. A formal theoretical treatment of such circuits that deal with their dynamics on the ?epigenetic landscape? could offer some guidance to find the optimal way of cell reprogramming.}},

Phenotypic classification of these structures has traditionally relied on qualitative scoring systems that limit detailed phenotypic comparisons between strains. Automated imaging and quantitative analysis have the potential to improve the speed and accuracy of experiments designed to study the genetic and molecular networks underlying different morphological traits. For this reason, we have developed a platform that uses automated image analysis and pattern recognition to quantify phenotypic signatures of yeast colonies. Our strategy enables quantitative analysis of individual colonies, measured at a single time point or over a series of time-lapse images, as well as the classification of distinct colony shapes based on image-derived features. Phenotypic changes in colony morphology can be expressed as changes in feature space trajectories over time, thereby enabling the visualization and quantitative analysis of morphological development. To facilitate data exploration, results are plotted dynamically through an interactive Yeast Image Analysis web application (YIMAA; http://yimaa.cs.tut.fi) that integrates the raw and processed images across all time points, allowing exploration of the image-based features and principal components associated with morphological development.}},

However, there is a severe shortage of donor organs, and as a result of the increasing demand, the gap between supply and demand continues to widen. A potential solution to this problem is to grow or fabricate organs using biomaterial scaffolds and a person's own cells. Although the realization of this solution has been limited, the development of new biofabrication approaches has made it more realistic. This review provides an overview of natural and synthetic biomaterials that have been used for organ/tissue development. It then discusses past and current biofabrication techniques, with a brief explanation of the state of the art. Finally, the review highlights the need for combining vascularization strategies with current biofabrication techniques. Given the multitude of applications of biofabrication technologies, from organ/tissue development to drug discovery/screening to development of complex in vitro models of human diseases, these manufacturing technologies can have a significant impact on the future of medicine and health care.}},

@article{Kang2014Biocellion,
    abstract = {{Biological system behaviors are often the outcome of complex interactions among a large number of cells and their biotic and abiotic environment. Computational biologists attempt to understand, predict and manipulate biological system behavior through mathematical modeling and computer simulation. Discrete agent-based modeling (in combination with high-resolution grids to model the extracellular environment) is a popular approach for building biological system models. However, the computational complexity of this approach forces computational biologists to resort to coarser resolution approaches to simulate large biological systems. High-performance parallel computers have the potential to address the computing challenge, but writing efficient software for parallel computers is difficult and time-consuming. We have developed Biocellion, a high-performance software framework, to solve this computing challenge using parallel computers. To support a wide range of multicellular biological system models, Biocellion asks users to provide their model specifics by filling the function body of pre-defined model routines. Using Biocellion, modelers without parallel computing expertise can efficiently exploit parallel computers with less effort than writing sequential programs from scratch. We simulate cell sorting, microbial patterning and a bacterial system in soil aggregate as case studies. Biocellion runs on x86 compatible systems with the 64 bit Linux operating system and is freely available for academic use.

@article{Takahashi2005Vascular,
    abstract = {{The VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family and its receptors are essential regulators of angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Currently, the VEGF family consists of VEGF-A, PlGF (placenta growth factor), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E and snake venom VEGF. VEGF-A has at least nine subtypes due to the alternative splicing of a single gene. Although the VEGF165 isoform plays a central role in vascular development, recent studies have demonstrated that each VEGF isoform plays distinct roles in vascular patterning and arterial development. VEGF-A binds to and activates two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR (VEGF receptor)-1 and VEGFR-2. VEGFR-2 mediates most of the endothelial growth and survival signals, but VEGFR-1-mediated signalling plays important roles in pathological conditions such as cancer, ischaemia and inflammation. In solid tumours, VEGF-A and its receptor are involved in carcinogenesis, invasion and distant metastasis as well as tumour angiogenesis. VEGF-A also has a neuroprotective effect on hypoxic motor neurons, and is a modifier of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Recent progress in the molecular and biological understanding of the VEGF/VEGFR system provides us with novel and promising therapeutic strategies and target proteins for overcoming a variety of diseases.}},

Emerging data support a proposition that two modes of unconventional resistance underlie such results: evasive resistance, an adaptation to circumvent the specific angiogenic blockade; and intrinsic or pre-existing indifference. Multiple mechanisms can be invoked in different tumour contexts to manifest both evasive and intrinsic resistance, motivating assessment of their prevalence and importance and in turn the design of pharmacological strategies that confer enduring anti-angiogenic therapies.}},

@article{Klingberg2013Myofibroblast,
    abstract = {{Myofibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in which they reside, are critical components of wound healing and fibrosis. The ECM, traditionally viewed as the structural elements within which cells reside, is actually a functional tissue whose components possess not only scaffolding characteristics, but also growth factor, mitogenic, and other bioactive properties. Although it has been suggested that tissue fibrosis simply reflects an 'exuberant' wound-healing response, examination of the ECM and the roles of myofibroblasts during fibrogenesis instead suggest that the organism may be attempting to recapitulate developmental programmes designed to regenerate functional tissue. Evidence of this is provided by the temporospatial re-emergence of embryonic ECM proteins by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts that induce cellular programmatic responses intended to produce a functional tissue. In the setting of wound healing (or physiological fibrosis), this occurs in a highly regulated and exquisitely choreographed fashion which results in cessation of haemorrhage, restoration of barrier integrity, and re-establishment of tissue function. However, pathological tissue fibrosis, which oftentimes causes organ dysfunction and significant morbidity or mortality, likely results from dysregulation of normal wound-healing processes or abnormalities of the process itself. This review will focus on the myofibroblast ECM and its role in both physiological and pathological fibrosis, and will discuss the potential for therapeutically targeting ECM proteins for treatment of fibrotic disorders.}},

A reconstruction provides a structured representation of the biochemical transformations occurring within an organism, as well as the genes necessary to carry out these transformations, as determined by the annotated genome sequence and experimental data. Network reconstructions also serve as platforms for constraint-based computational techniques, which facilitate biological studies in a variety of applications, including evaluation of network properties, metabolic engineering and drug discovery. Bottom-up metabolic network reconstructions have been developed for dozens of organisms, but until recently, the pace of reconstruction has failed to keep up with advances in genome sequencing. To address this problem, a number of software platforms have been developed to automate parts of the reconstruction process, thereby alleviating much of the manual effort previously required. Here, we review four such platforms in the context of established guidelines for network reconstruction. While many steps of the reconstruction process have been successfully automated, some manual evaluation of the results is still required to ensure a high-quality reconstruction. Widespread adoption of these platforms by the scientific community is underway and will be further enabled by exchangeable formats across platforms.}},

    abstract = {{Systems Biology is a multi-disciplinary research field with the aim of understanding the function of complex processes in living organisms. These intracellular processes are described by biochemical networks. Experimental studies in alliance with computer simulation lead to a continually increasing amount of data in liaison with different layers of biochemical networks. Thus, visualization is very important for getting an overview of data in association with the network components. Omix is a software for the visualization of any data in biochemical networks. The unique feature of Omix is: the software is programmable by a scripting language called Omix Visualization Language (OVL). In Omix, the visualization of data coming from experiment or simulation is completely performed by the software user realized in concise OVL scripts. By this, visualization becomes most flexible and adaptable to the requirements of the user and can be adapted to new application fields. We present four case studies of visualizing data of diverse kind in biochemical networks on metabolic level by using Omix and the OVL scripting language. These worked examples demonstrate the power of OVL in conjunction with pleasing visualization, an important requirement for successful interdisciplinary communication in the interface between more experimental and more theoretical researchers.

@article{Enjalbert2011Intuitive,
    abstract = {{Combinations of 'omics' investigations (i.e, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and/or fluxomic) are increasingly applied to get comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Because the latter are organized as complex networks of molecular and functional interactions, the intuitive interpretation of multi-omics datasets is difficult. Here we describe a simple strategy to visualize and analyze multi-omics data. Graphical representations of complex biological networks can be generated using Cytoscape where all molecular and functional components could be explicitly represented using a set of dedicated symbols. This representation can be used i) to compile all biologically-relevant information regarding the network through web link association, and ii) to map the network components with multi-omics data. A Cytoscape plugin was developed to increase the possibilities of both multi-omic data representation and interpretation. This plugin allowed different adjustable colour scales to be applied to the various omics data and performed the automatic extraction and visualization of the most significant changes in the datasets. For illustration purpose, the approach was applied to the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli. The obtained network contained 774 components and 1232 interactions, highlighting the complexity of bacterial multi-level regulations. The structured representation of this network represents a valuable resource for systemic studies of E. coli, as illustrated from the application to multi-omics data. Some current issues in network representation are discussed on the basis of this work.}},

@article{Lardon2011IDynoMiCS,
    abstract = {{Individual-based modelling of biofilms accounts for the fact that individual organisms of the same species may well be in a different physiological state as a result of environmental gradients, lag times in responding to change, or noise in gene expression, which we have become increasingly aware of with the advent of single-cell microbiology. But progress in developing and using individual-based modelling has been hampered by different groups writing their own code and the lack of an available standard model. We therefore set out to merge most features of previous models and incorporate various improvements in order to provide a common basis for further developments. Four improvements stand out: the biofilm pressure field allows for shrinking or consolidating biofilms; the continuous-in-time extracellular polymeric substances excretion leads to more realistic fluid behaviour of the extracellular matrix, avoiding artefacts; the stochastic chemostat mode allows comparison of spatially uniform and heterogeneous systems; and the separation of growth kinetics from the individual cell allows condition-dependent switching of metabolism. As an illustration of the model's use, we used the latter feature to study how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of denitrifying bacteria that induce the denitrification pathway under anoxic or low oxygen conditions. We tested the hypothesis that the existence of these diverse strategies of denitrification can be explained solely by assuming that faster response incurs higher costs. We found that if the ability to switch metabolic pathways quickly incurs no costs the fastest responder is always the best. However, if there is a trade-off where faster switching incurs higher costs, then there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations, suggesting that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different environments. In a single environment, biodiversity of denitrifiers is higher in biofilms than chemostats, higher with than without costs and higher at intermediate frequency of change. The highly modular nature of the new computational model made this case study straightforward to implement, and reflects the sort of novel studies that can easily be executed with the new model.}},

@article{Alpkvist2006Threedimensional,
    abstract = {{ An innovative type of biofilm model is derived by combining an individual description of microbial particles with a continuum representation of the biofilm matrix. This hybrid model retains the advantages of each approach, while providing a more realistic description of the temporal development of biofilm structure in two or three spatial dimensions. The general model derivation takes into account any possible number of soluble components. These are substrates and metabolic products, which diffuse and react in the biofilm within individual microbial cells. The cells grow, divide, and produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in a multispecies model setting. The EPS matrix is described by a continuum representation as incompressible viscous fluid, which can expand and retract due to generation and consumption processes. The cells move due to a pushing mechanism between cells in colonies and by an advective mechanism supported by the EPS dynamics. Detachment of both cells and EPS follows a continuum approach, whereas cells attach in discrete events. Two case studies are presented for model illustration. Biofilm consolidation is explained by shrinking due to EPS and cell degradation processes. This mechanism describes formation of a denser layer of cells in the biofilm depth and occurrence of an irregularly shaped biofilm surface under nutrient limiting conditions. Micro-colony formation is investigated by growth of autotrophic microbial colonies in an EPS matrix produced by heterotrophic cells. Size and shape of colonies of ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are comparatively studied in a standard biofilm and in biofilms aerated from a membrane side.

    abstract = {{From microbial biofilm communities to multicellular organisms, 3D macroscopic structures develop through poorly understood interplay between cellular processes and mechanical forces. Investigating wrinkled biofilms of Bacillus subtilis, we discovered a pattern of localized cell death that spatially focuses mechanical forces, and thereby initiates wrinkle formation. Deletion of genes implicated in biofilm development, together with mathematical modeling, revealed that ECM production underlies the localization of cell death. Simultaneously with cell death, we quantitatively measured mechanical stiffness and movement in WT and mutant biofilms. Results suggest that localized cell death provides an outlet for lateral compressive forces, thereby promoting vertical mechanical buckling, which subsequently leads to wrinkle formation. Guided by these findings, we were able to generate artificial wrinkle patterns within biofilms. Formation of 3D structures facilitated by cell death may underlie self-organization in other developmental systems, and could enable engineering of macroscopic structures from cell populations.}},

@article{Granek2010Environmental,
    abstract = {{Nutrient stresses trigger a variety of developmental switches in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One of the least understood of such responses is the development of complex colony morphology, characterized by intricate, organized, and strain-specific patterns of colony growth and architecture. The genetic bases of this phenotype and the key environmental signals involved in its induction have heretofore remained poorly understood. By surveying multiple strain backgrounds and a large number of growth conditions, we show that limitation for fermentable carbon sources coupled with a rich nitrogen source is the primary trigger for the colony morphology response in budding yeast. Using knockout mutants and transposon-mediated mutagenesis, we demonstrate that two key signaling networks regulating this response are the filamentous growth MAP kinase cascade and the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway. We further show synergistic epistasis between Rim15, a kinase involved in integration of nutrient signals, and other genes in these pathways. Ploidy, mating-type, and genotype-by-environment interactions also appear to play a role in the controlling colony morphology. Our study highlights the high degree of network reuse in this model eukaryote; yeast use the same core signaling pathways in multiple contexts to integrate information about environmental and physiological states and generate diverse developmental outputs. Baker's yeast forms smooth round colonies when grown in favorable conditions. When starved for one or more nutrients, yeast can alter its growth pattern to produce complex structures consisting of numerous interacting cells. One mode of growth, the colony morphology response, produces visually striking, lacy colony architectures. We describe both conditions that induce this morphology and also genes and pathways that are required for the response. We demonstrate that low levels of carbon combined with abundant nitrogen trigger complex colony formation. Using a candidate gene approach coupled with genome-wide mutagenesis, we identified genes involved in the production of complex colony morphology. Many of these genes are components of either a MAP kinase cascade or the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway, two well-studied signaling pathways that are conserved across eukaryotic organisms. Yeast use these pathways to mediate cellular responses to changes in their environment. We observe shared characteristics between complex colonies and biofilms, which are organized communities of microorganisms with relevance to human health and human infrastructure, making colony morphology a candidate model for understanding how microorganisms interact to form complex structures.}},

    abstract = {{ Many bacteria on earth exist in surface-attached communities known as biofilms. These films are responsible for manifold problems, including hospital-acquired infections and biofouling, but they can also be beneficial. Biofilm growth depends on the transport of nutrients and waste, for which diffusion is thought to be the main source of transport. However, diffusion is ineffective for transport over large distances and thus should limit growth. Nevertheless, biofilms can grow to be very large. Here we report the presence of a remarkable network of well-defined channels that form in wild-type Bacillus subtilis biofilms and provide a system for enhanced transport. We observe that these channels have high permeability to liquid flow and facilitate the transport of liquid through the biofilm. In addition, we find that spatial variations in evaporative flux from the surface of these biofilms provide a driving force for the flow of liquid in the channels. These channels offer a remarkably simple system for liquid transport, and their discovery provides insight into the physiology and growth of biofilms. }},

    abstract = {{Many microbial species form multicellular structures comprising elaborate wrinkles and concentric rings, yet the rules governing their architecture are poorly understood. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces phenazines, small molecules that act as alternate electron acceptors to oxygen and nitrate to oxidize the intracellular redox state and that influence biofilm morphogenesis. Here, we show that the depth occupied by cells within colony biofilms correlates well with electron acceptor availability. Perturbations in the environmental provision, endogenous production, and utilization of electron acceptors affect colony development in a manner consistent with redox control. Intracellular NADH levels peak before the induction of colony wrinkling. These results suggest that redox imbalance is a major factor driving the morphogenesis of P. aeruginosa biofilms and that wrinkling itself is an adaptation that maximizes oxygen accessibility and thereby supports metabolic homeostasis. This type of redox-driven morphological change is reminiscent of developmental processes that occur in metazoans.}},

@article{Donlan2002Biofilms,
    abstract = {{Though biofilms were first described by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, the theory describing the biofilm process was not developed until 1978. We now understand that biofilms are universal, occurring in aquatic and industrial water systems as well as a large number of environments and medical devices relevant for public health. Using tools such as the scanning electron microscope and, more recently, the confocal laser scanning microscope, biofilm researchers now understand that biofilms are not unstructured, homogeneous deposits of cells and accumulated slime, but complex communities of surface-associated cells enclosed in a polymer matrix containing open water channels. Further studies have shown that the biofilm phenotype can be described in terms of the genes expressed by biofilm-associated cells. Microorganisms growing in a biofilm are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents by one or more mechanisms. Biofilm-associated microorganisms have been shown to be associated with several human diseases, such as native valve endocarditis and cystic fibrosis, and to colonize a wide variety of medical devices. Though epidemiologic evidence points to biofilms as a source of several infectious diseases, the exact mechanisms by which biofilm-associated microorganisms elicit disease are poorly understood. Detachment of cells or cell aggregates, production of endotoxin, increased resistance to the host immune system, and provision of a niche for the generation of resistant organisms are all biofilm processes which could initiate the disease process. Effective strategies to prevent or control biofilms on medical devices must take into consideration the unique and tenacious nature of biofilms. Current intervention strategies are designed to prevent initial device colonization, minimize microbial cell attachment to the device, penetrate the biofilm matrix and kill the associated cells, or remove the device from the patient. In the future, treatments may be based on inhibition of genes involved in cell attachment and biofilm formation.}},

@article{Ratushny2008Control,
    abstract = {{In yeast, beta-oxidation of fatty acids (FAs) takes place in the peroxisome, an organelle whose size and number are controlled in response to environmental cues. The expression of genes required for peroxisome assembly and function is controlled by a transcriptional regulatory network that is induced by FAs such as oleate. The core FA-responsive transcriptional network consists of carbon source-sensing transcription factors that regulate key target genes through an overlapping feed-forward network motif (OFFNM). However, a systems-level understanding of the function of this network architecture in regulating dynamic FA-induced gene expression is lacking. The specific role of the OFFNM in regulating the dynamic and cell-population transcriptional response to oleate was investigated using a kinetic model comprised of four core transcription factor genes (ADR1, OAF1, PIP2, and OAF3) and two reporter genes (CTA1 and POT1) that are indicative of peroxisome induction. Simulations of the model suggest that 1), the intrinsic Adr1p-driven feed-forward loop reduces the steady-state expression variability of target genes; 2), the parallel Oaf3p-driven inhibitory feed-forward loop modulates the dynamic response of target genes to a transiently varying oleate concentration; and 3), heterodimerization of Oaf1p and Pip2p does not appear to have a noise-reducing function in the context of oleate-dependent expression of target genes. The OFFNM is highly overrepresented in the yeast regulome, suggesting that the specific functions described for the OFFNM, or other properties of this motif, provide a selective advantage.}},

Regardless of their specific molecular interactions, the majority of these mechanisms require morphogen gradients as the spatial cue, which are either predefined or generated as a part of the patterning process. However, using Escherichia coli programmed by a synthetic gene circuit, we demonstrate here the generation of robust, self-organized ring patterns of gene expression in the absence of an apparent morphogen gradient. Instead of being a spatial cue, the morphogen serves as a timing cue to trigger the formation and maintenance of the ring patterns. The timing mechanism enables the system to sense the domain size of the environment and generate patterns that scale accordingly. Our work defines a novel mechanism of pattern formation that has implications for understanding natural developmental processes.}},

Here we demonstrate that exposure to ferric chloride triggers rugose biofilm formation by the uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain UTI89 and by enteric bacteria Citrobacter koseri and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. Two unique and separable cellular populations emerge in iron-triggered, rugose biofilms. Bacteria at the air–biofilm interface express high levels of the biofilm regulator csgD, the cellulose activator adrA, and the curli subunit operon csgBAC. Bacteria in the interior of rugose biofilms express low levels of csgD and undetectable levels of matrix components curli and cellulose. Iron activation of rugose biofilms is linked to oxidative stress. Superoxide generation, either through addition of phenazine methosulfate or by deletion of sodA and sodB, stimulates rugose biofilm formation in the absence of high iron. Additionally, overexpression of Mn-superoxide dismutase, which can mitigate iron-derived reactive oxygen stress, decreases biofilm formation in a WT strain upon iron exposure. Not only does reactive oxygen stress promote rugose biofilm formation, but bacteria in the rugose biofilms display increased resistance to H2O2 toxicity. Altogether, we demonstrate that iron and superoxide stress trigger rugose biofilm formation in UTI89. Rugose biofilm development involves the elaboration of two distinct bacterial populations and increased resistance to oxidative stress.}},

A biochemically accurate model of molecular biology and metabolism will facilitate comprehensive and quantitative computations of an organism's molecular constitution as a function of genetic and environmental parameters. Here we formulate a model of metabolism and macromolecular expression. Prototyping it using the simple microorganism Thermotoga maritima, we show our model accurately simulates variations in cellular composition and gene expression. Moreover, through in silico comparative transcriptomics, the model allows the discovery of new regulons and improving the genome and transcription unit annotations. Our method presents a framework for investigating molecular biology and cellular physiology in silico and may allow quantitative interpretation of multi-omics data sets in the context of an integrated biochemical description of an organism. }},

    abstract = {{Specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed to silence different oncogenic pathways can be used for cancer therapy. However, non-modified naked siRNAs have short half-lives in blood serum and encounter difficulties in crossing biological membranes due to their negative charge. These obstacles can be overcome by using siRNAs complexed with bolaamphiphiles, consisting of two positively charged head groups that flank an internal hydrophobic chain. Bolaamphiphiles have relatively low toxicities, long persistence in the blood stream, and most importantly, in aqueous conditions can form poly-cationic micelles thus, becoming amenable to association with siRNAs. Herein, two different bolaamphiphiles with acetylcholine head groups attached to an alkyl chain in two distinct configurations are compared for their abilities to complex with siRNAs and deliver them into cells inducing gene silencing. Our explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that bolaamphiphiles associate with siRNAs due to electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. These in silico studies are supported by various in vitro and in cell culture experimental techniques as well as by some in vivo studies. Results demonstrate that depending on the application, the extent of siRNA chemical protection, delivery efficiency, and further intracellular release can be varied by simply changing the type of bolaamphiphile used.}},

The completion of the human genome-sequencing project, coupled to major technological developments, has afforded investigators myriad opportunities for multidimensional analysis of biological systems. Nowhere has this research explosion been more evident than in the field of transcriptomics. Affordable access and availability to the technology that supports such investigations has led to a significant increase in the amount of data generated. As most biological distinctions are now observed at a genomic level, a large amount of expression information is now openly available via public databases. Furthermore, numerous computational based methods have been developed to harness the power of these data. In this review we provide a brief overview of in silico methodologies for the analysis of differential gene expression such as Serial Analysis of Gene Expression and Digital Differential Display. The performance of these strategies, at both an operational and result/output level is assessed and compared. The key considerations that must be made when completing an in silico expression analysis are also presented as a roadmap to facilitate biologists. Furthermore, to highlight the importance of these in silico methodologies in contemporary biomedical research, examples of current studies using these approaches are discussed. The overriding goal of this review is to present the scientific community with a critical overview of these strategies, so that they can be effectively added to the tool box of biomedical researchers focused on identifying the molecular mechanisms of disease.}},

Metabolic networks are the representation of these processes describing the complex interactions of biochemical compounds. The large amount of manifold data concerning metabolic networks continually arising from current research activities in biotechnology leads to the great challenge of information visualization. Visualizing information in networks first of all requires appropriate network diagrams. In the context of metabolic networks, historical conventions regarding the network layout have been established. These layouts are not realizable by prevailing algorithms for automatic graph drawing. Hence, manual graph drawing is the predominating way to set up metabolic network diagrams. This is very time-consuming without software support, especially considering large networks with more than 500 nodes. We present a semi-automatic approach to drawing networks which relies on manual editing supported by two concepts of the interactive and automatic arrangement of nodes and edges. The first concept, called the layout pattern, uses an arbitrarily shaped skeleton as a backbone for the arrangement of nodes and edges. The second concept allows us to wrap a set of repeating drawing steps onto a so-called motif stamp, which can be appended to other parts of a diagram during the drawing process. Finally, a case study demonstrates that both semi-automatic drawing techniques diminish the time to be devoted for the manual network drawing process.}},

Still, because our knowledge of even well-studied model organisms such as this one is incomplete, this network reconstruction contains gaps and possible errors. There are a total of 208 blocked metabolites in iJO1366, representing gaps in the network.RESULTS:A new model improvement workflow was developed to compare model based phenotypic predictions to experimental data to fill gaps and correct errors. A Keio Collection based dataset of E. coli gene essentiality was obtained from literature data and compared to model predictions. The SMILEY algorithm was then used to predict the most likely missing reactions in the reconstructed network, adding reactions from a KEGG based universal set of metabolic reactions. The feasibility of these putative reactions was determined by comparing updated versions of the model to the experimental dataset, and genes were predicted for the most feasible reactions.CONCLUSIONS:Numerous improvements to the iJO1366 metabolic reconstruction were suggested by these analyses. Experiments were performed to verify several computational predictions, including a new mechanism for growth on myo-inositol. The other predictions made in this study should be experimentally verifiable by similar means. Validating all of the predictions made here represents a substantial but important undertaking.}},

Directionalities and fluxes of reactions are constantly represented in the visualization while detailed information about reaction (ID, name and synonyms, and formula) and metabolite (ID, name and synonyms, and charged formula) appears placing the cursor on the item of interest. Additionally Paint4Net functionality can be used to: (1) get lists of involved metabolites and dead end metabolites of the visualized part of the network, (2) exclude (filter) particular metabolites from representation, (3) find isolated parts of a network and (4) find running cycles when all the substrates are cut down. Layout pictures can be saved in various formats and easily distributed. The Paint4Net is open source software under the GPL v3 license.

Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a 'cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80\% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module. }},

@article{Xia2010Nativesized,
    abstract = {{Spider dragline silk is a remarkably strong fiber that makes it attractive for numerous applications. Much has thus been done to make similar fibers by biomimic spinning of recombinant dragline silk proteins. However, success is limited in part due to the inability to successfully express native-sized recombinant silk proteins (250–320 kDa). Here we show that a 284.9 kDa recombinant protein of the spider Nephila clavipes is produced and spun into a fiber displaying mechanical properties comparable to those of the native silk. The native-sized protein, predominantly rich in glycine (44.9\%), was favorably expressed in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli within which the glycyl-tRNA pool was elevated. We also found that the recombinant proteins of lower molecular weight versions yielded inferior fiber properties. The results provide insight into evolution of silk protein size related to mechanical performance, and also clarify why spinning lower molecular weight proteins does not recapitulate the properties of native fibers. Furthermore, the silk expression, purification, and spinning platform established here should be useful for sustainable production of natural quality dragline silk, potentially enabling broader applications.}},

The COBRA Toolbox, a MATLAB package for implementing COBRA methods, was presented earlier. Here we present a substantial update of this in silico toolbox. Version 2.0 of the COBRA Toolbox expands the scope of computations by including in silico analysis methods developed since its original release. New functions include (i) network gap filling, (ii) (13)C analysis, (iii) metabolic engineering, (iv) omics-guided analysis and (v) visualization. As with the first version, the COBRA Toolbox reads and writes systems biology markup language-formatted models. In version 2.0, we improved performance, usability and the level of documentation. A suite of test scripts can now be used to learn the core functionality of the toolbox and validate results. This toolbox lowers the barrier of entry to use powerful COBRA methods. }},

    abstract = {{ The annotated full DNA sequence is becoming available for a growing number of organisms. This information along with additional biochemical and strain-specific data can be used to define metabolic genotypes and reconstruct cellular metabolic networks. The first free-living organism for which the entire genomic sequence was established was Haemophilus influenzae. Its metabolic network is reconstructed herein and contains 461 reactions operating on 367 intracellular and 84 extracellular metabolites. With the metabolic reaction network established, it becomes necessary to determine its underlying pathway structure as defined by the set of extreme pathways. The H. influenzae metabolic network was subdivided into six subsystems and the extreme pathways determined for each subsystem based on stoichiometric, thermodynamic, and systems-specific constraints. Positive linear combinations of these pathways can be taken to determine the extreme pathways for the complete system. Since these pathways span the capabilities of the full system, they could be used to address a number of important physiological questions. First, they were used to reconcile and curate the sequence annotation by identifying reactions whose function was not supported in any of the extreme pathways. Second, they were used to predict gene products that should be co-regulated and perhaps co-expressed. Third, they were used to determine the composition of the minimal substrate requirements needed to support the production of 51 required metabolic products such as amino acids, nucleotides, phospholipids, etc. Fourth, sets of critical gene deletions from core metabolism were determined in the presence of the minimal substrate conditions and in more complete conditions reflecting the environmental niche of H. influenzae in the human host. In the former case, 11 genes were determined to be critical while six remained critical under the latter conditions. This study represents an important milestone in theoretical biology, namely the establishment of the first extreme pathway structure of a whole genome. Copyright 2000 Academic Press. }},

Its primary map summarizes the metabolism in biological systems as annotated to date. Nodes in the map correspond to various chemical compounds and edges represent series of enzymatic reactions. In two other maps, iPath2.0 provides an overview of secondary metabolite biosynthesis and a hand-picked selection of important regulatory pathways and other functional modules, allowing a more general overview of protein functions in a genome or metagenome. iPath2.0's main interface is an interactive Flash-based viewer, which allows users to easily navigate and explore the complex pathway maps. In addition to the default pre-computed overview maps, iPath offers several data mapping tools. Users can upload various types of data and completely customize all nodes and edges of iPath2.0's maps. These customized maps give users an intuitive overview of their own data, guiding the analysis of various genomics and metagenomics projects. }},

@article{Guimera2007Classes,

These—typically non-trivial—structures, in turn, critically affect the dynamics and properties of the system. The focus of most current research on complex networks is, still, on global network properties. A caveat of this approach is that the relevance of global properties hinges on the premise that networks are homogeneous, whereas most real-world networks have a markedly modular structure. Here, we report that networks with different functions, including the Internet, metabolic, air transportation and protein interaction networks, have distinct patterns of connections among nodes with different roles, and that, as a consequence, complex networks can be classified into two distinct functional classes on the basis of their link type frequency. Importantly, we demonstrate that these structural features cannot be captured by means of often studied global properties.}},

The recent deluge of biological knowledge makes addressing this deficit a pressing concern. Toward this goal, we present the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), a visual language developed by a community of biochemists, modelers and computer scientists. SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way. We believe that SBGN will foster efficient and accurate representation, visualization, storage, exchange and reuse of information on all kinds of biological knowledge, from gene regulation, to metabolism, to cellular signaling.}},

Cells use signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms to coordinate multiple processes, allowing them to respond to and adapt to an ever-changing environment. The large number of components, the degree of interconnectivity and the complex control of cellular networks are becoming evident in the integrated genomic and proteomic analyses that are emerging. It is increasingly recognized that the understanding of properties that arise from whole-cell function require integrated, theoretical descriptions of the relationships between different cellular components. Recent theoretical advances allow us to describe cellular network structure with graph concepts and have revealed organizational features shared with numerous non-biological networks. We now have the opportunity to describe quantitatively a network of hundreds or thousands of interacting components. Moreover, the observed topologies of cellular networks give us clues about their evolution and how their organization influences their function and dynamic responses.}},

Functions enabling these calculations are included in the toolbox, allowing a user to input a genome-scale metabolic model distributed in Systems Biology Markup Language format and perform these calculations with just a few lines of code. The results are predictions of cellular behavior that have been verified as accurate in a growing body of research.

@book{Kan2002Metrics,
    abstract = {{From the Book:Looking at software engineering from a historical perspective, the 1960s and earlier could be viewed as the functional era, the 1970s the schedule era, the 1980s the cost era, and the 1990s and beyond the quality and efficiency era. In the 1960s, we learned how to exploit information technology to meet institutional needs and began to link software with the daily operations of institutions. In the 1970s, as the industry was characterized by massive schedule delays and cost overruns, the focus was on planning and control of software projects. Phase-based life-cycle models were introduced and analysis, like the mythical man-month, emerged. In the 1980s, hardware costs continued to decline, and information technology permeated every facet of our institutions and became available to individuals. As competition in the industry became keen and low-cost applications became widely implemented, the importance of productivity in software development increased significantly. Various cost models in software engineering were developed and used. In the late 1980s, the importance of quality was also recognized.The 1990s and beyond is certainly the quality era. With state-of-the-art technology now able to provide abundant functionality, customers demand high quality. Demand for quality is further intensified by the ever-increasing dependence of society on software. Billing errors, large-scale disrupted telephone services, and even missile failures during recent wars can all be traced to the issue of software quality. In this era, quality has been brought to the center of the software development process. From the standpoint of software vendors, quality is no longer an advantage factor inthe marketplace; it has become a necessary condition if a company is to compete successfully.Starting mid 1990s, two major factors emerged that proved to have unprecedented impact on not only software engineering but also on global business environments: business reengineering for efficiency and the Internet. Software development has to be more efficient and the quality level of the delivered products has to be high to meet requirements and to be successful. This is especially the case for mission-critical applications. The adverse impact of poor quality is much more significant and at a much wider scale; the quality ” dikes” that software provides were never more important. These factors will continue to affect software engineering for many years to come during this new millennium.Measurement plays a critical role in effective and efficient software development, as well as provides the scientific basis for software engineering that makes it a true engineering discipline. This book describes the software quality engineering metrics and models: quality planning, process improvement and quality control, in-process quality management, product engineering (design and code complexity), reliability estimation and projection, and analysis of customer satisfaction data. Many measurement books take an encyclopedic approach, in which every possible software measurement is included, but this book confines its scope to the metrics and models of software quality. Areas such as cost estimation, productivity, staffing, and performance measurement, for which numerous publications exist, are not covered.In this edition, seven new chapters have been added, covering in-process metrics for software testing, object-oriented metrics, availability metrics, in-process quality assessment, software project assessment, process improvement dos and don'ts, and measuring software process improvement. The chapter that described the AS/400 software quality management system has been eliminated. For the original chapters, updates and revisions have been made throughout, and new sections, figures, and tables were added.Two of the new chapters are special contributions from two experts. This is a key feature of the new edition. The chapter on the dos and don'ts of software process improvement was contributed by Patrick O'Toole. Patrick brings to this book a perspective on process improvement that I share as a practitioner. That perspective is based on practical experience, is project-centric, and is aligned with the strategic business imperative of the organization. Patrick also brings humor to this otherwise serious subject, making the reading of the chapter so much enjoyable. The chapter on measuring software process improvement is a special contribution by Capers Jones. A pioneer in software metrics, productivity research, software quality control and software assessments, Capers' work is well known nationally and internationally. His data-based and fact-based approach in software assessments and benchmarking studies is unparalleled. Based on experience and data from more than 10,000 projects, he brings to the readers a practical approach to software process improvement and the major quantitative findings related to software process improvement at the project and activity level. The chapter is a must read for software process professionals who are interested in quantitative measurements.Another new feature added to this edition is a set of recommendations for small teams that are starting to implement a metrics program, with minimum resources available. These recommendations are shown in the form of sidebar inserts in nine of the chapters. A number of examples in the book are based on small team projects and many methods and techniques are appropriate to large projects as well as small ones. This set of recommendations is from the perspective of small organizations using a small number of metrics, with the intent to effect improvement in their software development effort.This book is intended for use by software quality professionals; software project managers; software product managers; software development managers; software engineers; software product assurance personnel; and students in software engineering, management information systems, systems engineering, and quality engineering and management. For students, it is intended to provide a basis for a course at the upper-division undergraduate or graduate level. A number of software engineering, computer science, and quality engineering programs in the United States and overseas used the first edition of this book as a text.Themes of This BookThis book has several themes. First, balancing theory, techniques, and real-life examples, it provides practical guidelines in the practice of quality engineering in software development. Although equations and formulas are involved, the focus is on the understanding and applications of the metrics and models rather than mathematical derivations. Throughout the book, numerous real-life examples are used from the software development laboratory at IBM Rochester, Minnesota, home of the AS/400 and the IBM eServer iSeries computer systems, and from other companies in the software industry. IBM Rochester won the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1990. A number of metrics described in this book were being used dating back to that time, and many have been developed and refined since then. All metrics are substantiated by ample implementation experience. IBM Rochester develops and delivers numerous different size and type projects every year, including very large and complex as well as small ones; and they range from firmware, to operating systems, to middleware, to applications.Second, I attempt to provide complete coverage of the type of metrics and models in software quality engineering. In addition to general discussions about metrics and techniques, this book categorizes and covers four types of models: (1) quality management models; (2) software reliability and projection models; (3) complexity metrics and models; and (4) customer-view metrics, measurements, and models. These metrics and models cover the entire software development process from high-level design to testing and maintenance, as well as all phases of reliability. Furthermore, although this book is not on total quality management (TQM), it is a major consideration in the coverage of metrics. The philosophy of TQM is the linking of product quality with customer satisfaction in order to achieve long-term success. TQM is the reason for including two chapters on the customer-view metrics and measurements—availability metrics and customer satisfaction—in addition to the many chapters on product and process metrics. In other discussions in the book, the customer's perspective is also included where appropriate.Third, linking metrics and models to quality improvement strategies and improvement actions, we attempt to focus on using, not just describing, metrics. A framework for interpreting in-process metrics and assessing in-process quality status, the Effort/Outcome model, is presented. The direct link between a recommended quality strategy during development and the defect-removal model is shown. Examples of actions tying to specific metrics and analysis are given. Furthermore, to illustrate the metrics, many figures are used. This is a direct reflection of the fact that in a real-life project and quality management, a clear visual presentation often improves understanding and increases the effectiveness of the metrics.Fourth, following up on quality and process improvement at a more general level rather than on specific metric discussions, the continues with chapters that discuss the in-process quality assessment process, a method for conducting software project assessments, practical advice on process improvement dos and don'ts, and quantitative analysis of software process improvement. The common thread underlying these chapters, and with other chapters on metrics and models, is practical experience with industry projects.Organization of This BookThe following list details what each chapter in this book addresses.Chapter 1, What Is Software Quality?, discusses the definition of quality and software quality. The customer's role in the definition is highlighted. Quality attributes and their interrelationships are discussed. In the second part of the chapter covers the definition and framework of TQM and the customer's view of quality, a key focus in this book.Chapter 2, Software Development Process Model, reviews various development process models that are used in the software industry. It briefly describes two methods of software process maturity assessment—the Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute's (SEI) process Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the Software Productivity Research (SPR) assessment method. It summarizes two bodies of quality management standards—the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award assessment discipline and ISO 9000. Chapter 3, Fundamentals in Measurement Theory, examines measurement theory fundamentals, which are very important for the practice of software measurement. The concept of operational definition and its importance in measurement are illustrated with an example. The level of measurement, some basic measures, and the concept of six sigma are discussed. The two key criteria of measurement quality, reliability and validity, and the related issue of measurement errors are examined and their importance is articulated. This chapter also provides a discussion on correlation and addresses the criteria needed to establish causality based on observational data. Chapter 4, Software Quality Metrics Overview, presents examples of quality metrics for the three categories of metrics associated with the software life-cycle: end-product, in-process, and maintenance. It describes the metrics programs of several large software companies and discusses software engineering data collection. Chapter 5, Applying the Seven Basic Quality Tools in Software Development, describes the application of the basic statistical tools for quality control, known as Ishikawa's seven basic tools, in software development. The potentials and challenges of applying the control chart in software environments are discussed. In addition, a qualitative tool for brainstorming and for displaying complex cause-and-effect relationships—the relations diagram—is discussed. Chapter 6, Defect Removal Effectiveness, is the first of five chapters about the models and metrics that describe the quality dynamics of software development. Through two types of models, quality management models and software reliability and projection models, the quality of software development can be planned, engineered, managed, and projected. This chapter examines the central concept of defect-removal effectiveness, its measurements, and its role in quality planning.Chapter 7, The Rayleigh Model, describes the model and its implementation as a reliability and projection model. The Rayleigh Model's use as a quality management model is discussed in Chapter 9.Chapter 8, Exponential Distribution and Reliability Growth Models, discusses the exponential distribution and the major software reliability growth models. These models, like the Rayleigh Model, are used for quality projection before the software is shipped to customers, just before development is complete. The models are also used to model the failure pattern or the defect arrival patterns in the field, for maintenance planning.Chapter 9, Quality Management Models, describes several quality management models that cover the entire development cycle. In-process metrics and reports that support the models are shown and discussed. A framework for interpreting in-process metrics and assessing in-process quality status—the Effort/Outcome model, is presented. Chapter 10, In-Process Metrics for Software Testing, is a continuation of Chapter 9; it focuses on the metrics for software testing. The Effort/Outcome model, as it applies to metrics during the testing phase, is elaborated. Candidate metrics for acceptance testing to evaluate vendor-developed software, and the central question of how do you know your product is good enough to ship, are also discussed.Chapter 11, Complexity Metrics and Models, discusses the third type of metrics and models in software engineering. While quality management models and reliability and projection models are for project management and quality management, the objective of the complexity metrics and models is for software engineers to be able to improve their design and implementation of software development. Chapter 12, Metrics and Lessons Learned for Object-Oriented Projects, covers design and complexity metrics, productivity metrics, quality and quality management metrics for object-oriented development, and lessons learned from the deployment and implementation of OO projects. The first section can be viewed as a continuation of the discussion on complexity metrics and models, while the other sections fall within the framework of quality and project management. Chapter 13, Availability Metrics, discusses system availability and outage metrics, and explores the relationships among availability, reliability, and the traditional defect-rate measurement. Availability metrics and customer satisfaction measurements are the fourth type of metrics and modelscustomer-oriented metrics. Chapter 14, Measuring and Analyzing Customer Satisfaction, discusses customer satisfaction data collection and measurements, and techniques and models for the analysis of customer satisfaction data. From Chapter 3 to this chapter, the entire spectrum of metrics and models is covered.Chapter 15, Conducting In-Process Quality Assessments, describes in-process quality assessments as an integrated element of good project quality management. Quality assessments are based on both quantitative indicators, such as those discussed in previous chapters, and qualitative information. Chapter 16, Conducting Software Project Assessments, takes the level of discussion yet another level higher; this chapter proposes a software project assessment method. The focus is at the project level and the discussion is from a practitioner's perspective. Chapter 17, Dos and Don'ts of Software Process Improvement by Patrick O'Toole, offers practical advice for software process improvement professionals. It provides a link to the process maturity discussions in Chapter 2. Chapter 18, Measuring Software Process Improvement by Capers Jones, discusses the six stages of software process improvement. Based on a large body of empirical data, it examines the costs and effects of process improvement. It shows the results of quantitative analyses with regard to costs, time, schedule, productivity, and quality. It provides a link to the process maturity discussions in Chapter 2.Chapter 19, Concluding Remarks, provides several observations with regard to software measurement in general and software quality metrics and models in particular, and it offers a perspective on the future of software engineering measurement.Suggested Ways to Read This BookThe chapters of this book are organized for reading from beginning to end. Concepts and discussions in earlier chapters are referenced in later chapters. At the same time, each chapter addresses a separate topic and chapters within some groups are more closely coupled to each other than to others. Some readers may choose to read specific topics or decide on different starting points. For example, those who are not interested in quality definitions, process models, and measurement fundamentals discussions, can start with Chapter 4, Software Quality Metrics Overview. Those who intend to immediately get to the central topics of defect removals and metrics and models for quality planning, management and projection, can start with Chapter 6, Defect Removal Effectiveness. In general, I recommend that you read the chapters together in groups, as follows.Chapters 1 to 3Chapter 4Chapter 5 Chapters 6 to 10Chapters 11 and 12Chapters 13 and 14Chapters 15 to 18Chapter 19}},

In this paper, we examine user-reported software defect occurrences across twenty-two releases of four widely-deployed business-critical production software systems: a commercial operating system, a commercial middleware system system, an open source operating system (OpenBSD), and an open source middleware system (Tomcat). We evaluate the suitability of common defect-occurrence models by first assessing the match between characteristics of widelydeployed production software systems and model structures then evaluating how well the models fit real world data. As our assessment led us to expect, we find that the Weibull model is flexible enough to capture defect-occurrence behavior}},

However, this is rarely the case for new software projects and for many companies. So far, only a few have studies focused on transferring prediction models from one project to another. In this paper, we study cross-project defect prediction models on a large scale. For 12 real-world applications, we ran 622 cross-project predictions. Our results indicate that cross-project prediction is a serious challenge, i.e., simply using models from projects in the same domain or with the same process does not lead to accurate predictions. To help software engineers choose models wisely, we identified factors that do influence the success of cross-project predictions. We also derived decision trees that can provide early estimates for precision, recall, and accuracy before a prediction is attempted.}},

@article{Fenton1999Critique,
    abstract = {{Many organizations want to predict the number of defects (faults) in software systems, before they are deployed, to gauge the likely delivered quality and maintenance effort. To help in this numerous software metrics and statistical models have been developed, with a correspondingly large literature. We provide a critical review of this literature and the state-of-the-art. Most of the wide range of prediction models use size and complexity metrics to predict defects. Others are based on testing data, the ” quality” of the development process, or take a multivariate approach. The authors of the models have often made heroic contributions to a subject otherwise bereft of empirical studies. However, there are a number of serious theoretical and practical problems in many studies. The models are weak because of their inability to cope with the, as yet, unknown relationship between defects and failures. There are fundamental statistical and data quality problems that undermine model validity. More significantly many prediction models tend to model only part of the underlying problem and seriously misspecify it. To illustrate these points the Goldilock's Conjecture, that there is an optimum module size, is used to show the considerable problems inherent in current defect prediction approaches. Careful and considered analysis of past and new results shows that the conjecture lacks support and that some models are misleading. We recommend holistic models for software defect prediction, using Bayesian belief networks, as alternative approaches to the single-issue models used at present. We also argue for research into a theory of ” software decomposition” in order to test hypotheses about defect introduction and help construct a better science of software engineering}},

The basic assumption is that faults do not occur in isolation, but rather in bursts of several related faults. Therefore, we cache locations that are likely to have faults: starting from the location of a known (fixed) fault, we cache the location itself, any locations changed together with the fault, recently added locations, and recently changed locations. By consulting the cache at the moment a fault is fixed, a developer can detect likely fault-prone locations. This is useful for prioritizing verification and validation resources on the most fault prone files or entities. In our evaluation of seven open source projects with more than 200,000 revisions, the cache selects 10\% of the source code files; these files account for 73\%-95\% of faults-- a significant advance beyond the state of the art.}},

A case study performed on Windows Server 2003 indicates the validity of the relative code churn measures as early indicators of system defect density. Furthermore, our code churn metric suite is able to discriminate between fault and not fault-prone binaries with an accuracy of 89.0 percent.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The rapid progress of post-genomic analyses, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has resulted in the generation of large amounts of quantitative data covering and connecting the complete cascade from genotype to phenotype for individual organisms. Various benefits can be achieved when these "Omics" data are integrated, such as the identification of unknown gene functions or the elucidation of regulatory networks of whole organisms. In order to be able to obtain deeper insights in the generated datasets, it is of utmost importance to present the data to the researcher in an intuitive, integrated, and knowledge-based environment. Therefore, various visualization paradigms have been established during the last years. The visualization of "Omics" data using metabolic pathway maps is intuitive and has been applied in various software tools. It has become obvious that the application of web-based and user driven software tools has great potential and benefits from the use of open and standardized formats for the description of pathways.RESULTS:In order to combine datasets from heterogeneous "Omics" sources, we present the web-based ProMeTra system that visualizes and combines datasets from transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics on user defined metabolic pathway maps. Therefore, structured exchange of data with our "Omics" applications Emma 2, Qupe and MeltDB is employed. Enriched SVG images or animations are generated and can be obtained via the user friendly web interface.To demonstrate the functionality of ProMeTra, we use quantitative data obtained during a fermentation experiment of the L-lysine producing strain Corynebacterium glutamicum DM1730. During fermentation, oxygen supply was switched off in order to perturb the system and observe its reaction. At six different time points, transcript abundances, intracellular metabolite pools, as well as extracellular glucose, lactate, and L-lysine levels were determined.CONCLUSION:The interpretation and visualization of the results of this complex experiment was facilitated by the ProMeTra software. Both transcriptome and metabolome data were visualized on a metabolic pathway map. Visual inspection of the combined data confirmed existing knowledge but also delivered novel correlations that are of potential biotechnological importance.}},

    abstract = {{Cellular metabolism, the integrated interconversion of thousands of metabolic substrates through enzyme-catalysed biochemical reactions, is the most investigated complex intracellular web of molecular interactions. Although the topological organization of individual reactions into metabolic networks is well understood1, 2, 3, 4, the principles that govern their global functional use under different growth conditions raise many unanswered questions5, 6, 7. By implementing a flux balance analysis8, 9, 10, 11, 12 of the metabolism of Escherichia coli strain MG1655, here we show that network use is highly uneven. Whereas most metabolic reactions have low fluxes, the overall activity of the metabolism is dominated by several reactions with very high fluxes. E. coli responds to changes in growth conditions by reorganizing the rates of selected fluxes predominantly within this high-flux backbone. This behaviour probably represents a universal feature of metabolic activity in all cells, with potential implications for metabolic engineering.}},

@article{Park2010Prediction,
    abstract = {{Flux balance analysis (FBA) of a genome-scale metabolic model allows calculation of intracellular fluxes by optimizing an objective function, such as maximization of cell growth, under given constraints, and has found numerous applications in the field of systems biology and biotechnology. Due to the underdetermined nature of the system, however, it has limitations such as inaccurate prediction of fluxes and existence of multiple solutions for an optimal objective value. Here, we report a strategy for accurate prediction of metabolic fluxes by FBA combined with systematic and condition-independent constraints that restrict the achievable flux ranges of grouped reactions by genomic context and flux-converging pattern analyses. Analyses of three types of genomic contexts, conserved genomic neighborhood, gene fusion events, and co-occurrence of genes across multiple organisms, were performed to suggest a group of fluxes that are likely on or off simultaneously. The flux ranges of these grouped reactions were constrained by flux-converging pattern analysis. FBA of the Escherichia coli genome-scale metabolic model was carried out under several different genotypic (pykF, zwf, ppc, and sucA mutants) and environmental (altered carbon source) conditions by applying these constraints, which resulted in flux values that were in good agreement with the experimentally measured (13)C-based fluxes. Thus, this strategy will be useful for accurately predicting the intracellular fluxes of large metabolic networks when their experimental determination is difficult.}},

To facilitate this research topic, we have developed a modeling/simulating tool called CellDesigner.

Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite. CellDesigner is implemented in Java and thus supports various platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, and MacOS X). CellDesigner is freely available via our Web site.}},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known—a collaboration network and a food web—and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.}},

    abstract = {{Regulatory networks play a central role in cellular behavior and decision making. Learning these regulatory networks is a major task in biology, and devising computational methods and mathematical models for this task is a major endeavor in bioinformatics. Boolean networks have been used extensively for modeling regulatory networks. In this model, the state of each gene can be either 'on' or 'off' and that next-state of a gene is updated, synchronously or asynchronously, according to a Boolean rule that is applied to the current-state of the entire system. Inferring a Boolean network from a set of experimental data entails two main steps: first, the experimental time-series data are discretized into Boolean trajectories, and then, a Boolean network is learned from these Boolean trajectories. In this paper, we consider three methods for data discretization, including a new one we propose, and three methods for learning Boolean networks, and study the performance of all possible nine combinations on four regulatory systems of varying dynamics complexities. We find that employing the right combination of methods for data discretization and network learning results in Boolean networks that capture the dynamics well and provide predictive power. Our findings are in contrast to a recent survey that placed Boolean networks on the low end of the  ” faithfulness to biological reality” and  ” ability to model dynamics” spectra. Further, contrary to the common argument in favor of Boolean networks, we find that a relatively large number of time points in the time-series data is required to learn good Boolean networks for certain data sets. Last but not least, while methods have been proposed for inferring Boolean networks, as discussed above, missing still are publicly available implementations thereof. Here, we make our implementation of the methods available publicly in open source at http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/.}},

We also review and compare the main techniques considered to represent finite sets in the context of logic languages. The resulting contraint algorithms are embedded in a Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) language which provides finite sets—along with basic set-theoretic operations—as first-class objects of the language. The language—called CLP(SET)—is an instance of the general CLP framework, and as such it inherits all the general features and theoretical results of this scheme. We provide, through programming examples, a taste of the expressive power offered by programming in CLP(SET.}},

    abstract = {{We determine stability and attractor properties of random Boolean genetic network models with canalyzing rules for a variety of architectures. For all power law, exponential, and flat in-degree distributions, we find that the networks are dynamically stable. Furthermore, for architectures with few inputs per node, the dynamics of the networks is close to critical. In addition, the fraction of genes that are active decreases with the number of inputs per node. These results are based upon investigating ensembles of networks using analytical methods. Also, for different in-degree distributions, the numbers of fixed points and cycles are calculated, with results intuitively consistent with stability analysis; fewer inputs per node implies more cycles, and vice versa. There are hints that genetic networks acquire broader degree distributions with evolution, and hence our results indicate that for single cells, the dynamics should become more stable with evolution. However, such an effect is very likely compensated for by multicellular dynamics, because one expects less stability when interactions among cells are included. We verify this by simulations of a simple model for interactions among cells.}},

The large number of components, the degree of interconnectivity and the complex control of cellular networks are becoming evident in the integrated genomic and proteomic analyses that are emerging. It is increasingly recognized that the understanding of properties that arise from whole-cell function require integrated, theoretical descriptions of the relationships between different cellular components. Recent theoretical advances allow us to describe cellular network structure with graph concepts and have revealed organizational features shared with numerous non-biological networks. We now have the opportunity to describe quantitatively a network of hundreds or thousands of interacting components. Moreover, the observed topologies of cellular networks give us clues about their evolution and how their organization influences their function and dynamic responses.}},

@article{Shah2011Robust,
    abstract = {{Signaling networks that convert graded stimuli into binary, all-or-none cellular responses are critical in processes ranging from cell-cycle control to lineage commitment. To exhaustively enumerate topologies that exhibit this switch-like behavior, we simulated all possible two- and three-component networks on random parameter sets, and assessed the resulting response profiles for both steepness (ultrasensitivity) and extent of memory (bistability). Simulations were used to study purely enzymatic networks, purely transcriptional networks, and hybrid enzymatic/transcriptional networks, and the topologies in each class were rank ordered by parametric robustness (i.e., the percentage of applied parameter sets exhibiting ultrasensitivity or bistability). Results reveal that the distribution of network robustness is highly skewed, with the most robust topologies clustering into a small number of motifs. Hybrid networks are the most robust in generating ultrasensitivity (up to 28\%) and bistability (up to 18\%); strikingly, a purely transcriptional framework is the most fragile in generating either ultrasensitive (up to 3\%) or bistable (up to 1\%) responses. The disparity in robustness among the network classes is due in part to zero-order ultrasensitivity, an enzyme-specific phenomenon, which repeatedly emerges as a particularly robust mechanism for generating nonlinearity and can act as a building block for switch-like responses. We also highlight experimentally studied examples of topologies enabling switching behavior, in both native and synthetic systems, that rank highly in our simulations. This unbiased approach for identifying topologies capable of a given response may be useful in discovering new natural motifs and in designing robust synthetic gene networks. Biomolecular signaling networks enable cells to mediate responses to extracellular and intracellular stimuli and are hence crucial for the functioning of all organisms. Such networks do not merely forward information, but perform signal processing: specific modules have evolved to produce complex, dynamic behaviors from input cues. Switching, or the conversion of a graded stimulus into a binary, all-or-none response, is a ubiquitous behavior that regulates critical processes ranging from cell division to stem cell differentiation. While a number of switch-generating networks have been identified, a comprehensive understanding of network architectures that can yield switch-like behavior remains elusive. In this work, we assessed the entire space of minimal networks to identify architectures that can not only exhibit switching behavior but can do so robustly in the dynamic and noisy cellular environment. Our results reveal that these robust networks fit into a small number of topological motifs. Furthermore, network composition (i.e., whether a signaling component functions as an enzyme or a transcription factor) can dramatically impact robustness in generating switching behavior. Topologies presented in this work can be used to identify additional circuits in nature that may exhibit switching behavior and suggest design strategies for engineering switching behavior in synthetic circuits.}},

    abstract = {{The study of biological networks and network motifs can yield significant new insights into systems biology. Previous methods of discovering network motifs – network-centric subgraph enumeration and sampling – have been limited to motifs of 6 to 8 nodes, revealing only the smallest network components. New methods are necessary to identify larger network sub-structures and functional motifs.
                          Here we present a novel algorithm for discovering large network motifs that achieves these goals, based on a novel symmetry-breaking technique, which eliminates repeated isomorphism testing, leading to an exponential speed-up over previous methods. This technique is made possible by reversing the traditional network-based search at the heart of the algorithm to a motif-based search, which also eliminates the need to store all motifs of a given size and enables parallelization and scaling. Additionally, our method enables us to study the clustering properties of discovered motifs, revealing even larger network elements.
                          We apply this algorithm to the protein-protein interaction network and transcription regulatory network of S. cerevisiae, and discover several large network motifs, which were previously inaccessible to existing methods, including a 29-node cluster of 15-node motifs corresponding to the key transcription machinery of S. cerevisiae.}},

Their role in cell differentiation can be affected by their position in the gene regulatory network. Here, we test whether the properties of the gene regulatory network can highlight which genes and proteins are associated with cell differentiation. We use a previously developed purely theoretical algorithm built to detect nodes that can induce a state change in Boolean gene regulatory networks, and show that most genes predicted to participate in differentiation in the theoretical framework are also experimentally known to be associated with such differentiation. These results show that genes related to differentiation are associated with specific features of the genetic regulatory network. The proposed algorithm produces a better classification than simple network measures such as the nodes degree or centrality. Boolean networks were used in many previous theoretical models. Here, we show a direct application of such networks to the detection of genes and subnetworks related to differentiation. The subnetwork emerging from the genes and edges that are predicted to be associated with differentiation are the most active molecular pathways experimentally described to be involved in cell differentiation.}},

    abstract = {{
                Understanding design principles of molecular interaction networks is an important goal of molecular systems biology. Some insights have been gained into features of their network topology through the discovery of graph theoretic patterns that constrain network dynamics. This paper contributes to the identification of patterns in the mechanisms that govern network dynamics. The control of nodes in gene regulatory, signaling, and metabolic networks is governed by a variety of biochemical mechanisms, with inputs from other network nodes that act additively or synergistically. This paper focuses on a certain type of logical rule that appears frequently as a regulatory pattern. Within the context of the multistate discrete model paradigm, a rule type is introduced that reduces to the concept of nested canalyzing function in the Boolean network case. It is shown that networks that employ this type of multivalued logic exhibit more robust dynamics than random networks, with few attractors and short limit cycles. It is also shown that the majority of regulatory functions in many published models of gene regulatory and signaling networks are nested canalyzing.

                The distinct cell types of multicellular organisms arise owing to constraints imposed by gene regulatory networks on the collective change of gene expression across the genome, creating self-stabilizing expression states, or attractors. We curated human expression data comprising 166 cell types and 2,602 transcription-regulating genes and developed a data-driven method for identifying putative determinants of cell fate built around the concept of expression reversal of gene pairs, such as those participating in toggle-switch circuits. This approach allows us to organize the cell types into their ontogenic lineage relationships. Our method identifies genes in regulatory circuits that control neuronal fate, pluripotency and blood cell differentiation, and it may be useful for prioritizing candidate factors for direct conversion of cell fate.

@article{Ghaffarizadeh2014Multistable,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Cellular differentiation during development is controlled by gene regulatory networks (GRNs). This complex process is always subject to gene expression noise. There is evidence suggesting that commonly seen patterns in GRNs, referred to as biological multistable switches, play an important role in creating the structure of lineage trees by providing stability to cell types.RESULTS:To explore this question a new methodology is developed and applied to study (a) the multistable switch-containing GRN for hematopoiesis and (b) a large set of random boolean networks (RBNs) in which multistable switches were embedded systematically. In this work, each network attractor is taken to represent a distinct cell type. The GRNs were seeded with one or two identical copies of each multistable switch and the effect of these additions on two key aspects of network dynamics was assessed. These properties are the barrier to movement between pairs of attractors (separation) and the degree to which one direction of movement between attractor pairs is favored over another (directionality). Both of these properties are instrumental in shaping the structure of lineage trees. We found that adding one multistable switch of any type had a modest effect on increasing the proportion of well-separated attractor pairs. Adding two identical switches of any type had a much stronger effect in increasing the proportion of well-separated attractors. Similarly, there was an increase in the frequency of directional transitions between attractor pairs when two identical multistable switches were added to GRNs. This effect on directionality was not observed when only one multistable switch was added.CONCLUSIONS:This work provides evidence that the occurrence of multistable switches in networks that control cellular differentiation contributes to the structure of lineage trees and to the stabilization of cell types.}},

@article{Guantes2008Multistable,
    abstract = {{It is now recognized that molecular circuits with positive feedback can induce two different gene expression states (bistability) under the very same cellular conditions. Whether, and how, cells make use of the coexistence of a larger number of stable states (multistability) is however largely unknown. Here, we first examine how autoregulation, a common attribute of genetic master regulators, facilitates multistability in two-component circuits. A systematic exploration of these modules' parameter space reveals two classes of molecular switches, involving transitions in bistable (progression switches) or multistable (decision switches) regimes. We demonstrate the potential of decision switches for multifaceted stimulus processing, including strength, duration, and flexible discrimination. These tasks enhance response specificity, help to store short-term memories of recent signaling events, stabilize transient gene expression, and enable stochastic fate commitment. The relevance of these circuits is further supported by biological data, because we find them in numerous developmental scenarios. Indeed, many of the presented information-processing features of decision switches could ultimately demonstrate a more flexible control of epigenetic differentiation. An essential attribute of living cells is the capacity to select among various alternatives when confronted with external or internal cues. These decisions can be directly linked to survival, as the sporulation/competence choice in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, or be involved in the establishment of developmental programs from pluripotent stem cells. How are these decisions controlled at the molecular level? Recent studies have identified the presence of a few master regulator genes whose activity is crucial to drive cells to a particular fate. These genes usually exhibit autoregulation and appear in combination with a second molecular partner constituting a minimal regulatory circuit. Here, we investigate how such two-component architectures endow cells with more than two epigenetic states. This ability not only enhances the number of potential developmental outcomes, in a given context, but also drastically increases cell signal processing. We show how these control modules can implement a number of complex computational tasks such as discrimination of stimulus amplitude, duration, or relative timing. Similar aspects have been discussed in relation to neural dynamics in cortical circuits, which suggests the use of equivalent computational strategies and circuit design in the control of biological decision-making.}},

    abstract = {{Understanding cellular differentiation is critical in explaining development and for taming diseases such as cancer. Differentiation is conventionally represented using bifurcating lineage trees. However, these lineage trees cannot readily capture or quantify all the types of transitions now known to occur between cell types, including transdifferentiation or differentiation off standard paths. This work introduces a new analysis and visualization technique that is capable of representing all possible transitions between cell states compactly, quantitatively, and intuitively. This method considers the regulatory network of transcription factors that control cell type determination and then performs an analysis of network dynamics to identify stable expression profiles and the potential cell types that they represent. A visualization tool called CellDiff3D creates an intuitive three-dimensional graph that shows the overall direction and probability of transitions between all pairs of cell types within a lineage. In this study, the influence of gene expression noise and mutational changes during myeloid cell differentiation are presented as a demonstration of the CellDiff3D technique, a new approach to quantify and envision all possible cell state transitions in any lineage network.}},

@article{Ghaffarizadeh2013Quantitative,
    abstract = {{The Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping problem aims to identify regions in the genome that are linked to phenotypic features of the developed organism that vary in degree. It is a principle step in determining targets for further genetic analysis and is key in decoding the role of specific genes that control quantitative traits within species. Applications include identifying genetic causes of disease, optimization of cross-breeding for desired traits and understanding trait diversity in populations. In this paper a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) method is introduced and is shown to increase the accuracy of QTL mapping identification for both independent and epistatic loci interactions. The MOEA method optimizes over the space of possible partial least squares (PLS) regression QTL models and considers the conflicting objectives of model simplicity versus model accuracy. By optimizing for minimal model complexity, MOEA has the advantage of solving the over-fitting problem of conventional PLS models. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by comparing the new method with Bayesian Interval Mapping approaches over a series of test cases where the optimal solutions are known. This approach can be applied to many problems that arise in analysis of genomic data sets where the number of features far exceeds the number of observations and where features can be highly correlated.}},

It is approximated by the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) which generates the relative distance between two strings by using standard compression algorithms to compare linear strings of information. This relative distance quantifies the degree of similarity between the two objects. NCD has been shown to measure similarity effectively on information which is already a string: genomic string comparisons have created accurate phylogeny trees and NCD has also been used to classify music. Currently, to find a similarity measure using NCD for images, the images must first be linearized into a string, and then compared. To understand how linearization of a 2D image affects the similarity measure, we perform four types of linearization on a subset of the Corel image database and compare each for a variety of image transformations. Our experiment shows that different linearization techniques produce statistically significant differences in NCD for identical spatial transformations.}},

    abstract = {{The balance between symmetry and randomness as a property of networks can be viewed as a kind of  ” complexity.” We use here our previously defined  ” set complexity” measure (Galas et al., IEEE Trans Inf Theory 2010, 56), which was used to approach the problem of defining biological information, in the mathematical analysis of networks. This information theoretic measure is used to explore the complexity of binary, undirected graphs. The complexities, Ψ, of some specific classes of graphs can be calculated in closed form. Some simple graphs have a complexity value of zero, but graphs with significant values of Ψ are rare. We find that the most complex of the simple graphs are the complete bipartite graphs (CBGs). In this simple case, the complexity, Ψ, is a strong function of the size of the two node sets in these graphs. We find the maximum Ψ binary graphs as well. These graphs are distinct from, but similar to CBGs. Finally, we explore directed and stochastic processes for growing graphs (hill-climbing and random duplication, respectively) and find that node duplication and partial node duplication conserve interesting graph properties. Partial duplication can grow extremely complex graphs, while full node duplication cannot do so. By examining the eigenvalue spectrum of the graph Laplacian we characterize the symmetry of the graphs and demonstrate that, in general, breaking specific symmetries of the binary graphs increases the set-based complexity, Ψ. The implications of these results for more complex, multiparameter graphs, and for physical and biological networks and the processes of network evolution are discussed. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This work applies the methods of information theory to understand how regulatory network structure both within and between cells relates to the complexity of spatial patterns that emerge as a consequence of network operation. A computational study was performed in which undifferentiated cells were arranged in a two dimensional lattice, with gene expression in each cell regulated by identical intracellular randomly generated Boolean networks. Cell–cell contact signalling between embryonic cells is modeled as coupling among intracellular networks so that gene expression in one cell can influence the expression of genes in adjacent cells. In this system, the initially identical cells differentiate and form patterns of different cell types. The complexity of network structure, temporal dynamics and spatial organization is quantified through the Kolmogorov-based measures of normalized compression distance and set complexity. Results over sets of random networks that operate in the ordered, critical and chaotic domains demonstrate that: (1) ordered and critical networks tend to create the most information-rich patterns; (2) signalling configurations in which cell-to-cell communication is non-directional mostly produce simple patterns irrespective of the internal network domain; and (3) directional signalling configurations, similar to those that function in planar cell polarity, produce the most complex patterns, but only when the intracellular networks function in non-chaotic domains.}},

                Due to the large number of variables required and the limited number of independent experiments, the inference of genetic regulatory networks from gene expression data is a challenge of long standing within the microarray field. This report investigates the inference of Boolean networks with perturbation (BNp) from simulated data and observed microarray data. We interpret the discrete expression levels as attractor states of the underlying network and use the sequence of attractor states to determine the model. We consider the case where a complete sequence of attractors is known and the case where the known attractor states are arrived at by sampling from an underlying sequence of attractors. In the former case, a BNp can be inferred trivially, for an arbitrary number of genes and attractors. In the latter case, we use the constraints posed by the distribution of attractor states and the need to conserve probability to arrive at one of three possible solutions: an unique, exact network; several exact networks or a 'most-likely' network. In the case of several exact networks we use a robustness requirement to select a preferred network. In the case that an exact option is not found, we select the network that best fits the observed attractor distribution. We apply the resulting algorithm to the interferon regulatory network using expression data taken from murine bone-derived macrophage cells infected with cytomegalovirus.

Recent work has shown that mouse and human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state with a combination of four transcription factors. This raised the question of whether transcription factors could directly induce other defined somatic cell fates, and not only an undifferentiated state. We hypothesized that combinatorial expression of neural-lineage-specific transcription factors could directly convert fibroblasts into neurons. Starting from a pool of nineteen candidate genes, we identified a combination of only three factors, Ascl1, Brn2 (also called Pou3f2) and Myt1l, that suffice to rapidly and efficiently convert mouse embryonic and postnatal fibroblasts into functional neurons in vitro. These induced neuronal (iN) cells express multiple neuron-specific proteins, generate action potentials and form functional synapses. Generation of iN cells from non-neural lineages could have important implications for studies of neural development, neurological disease modelling and regenerative medicine.}},

                The induction of pluripotency or trans-differentiation of one cell type to another can be accomplished with cell-lineage-specific transcription factors. Here, we report that repression of a single RNA binding polypyrimidine-tract-binding (PTB) protein, which occurs during normal brain development via the action of miR-124, is sufficient to induce trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into functional neurons. Besides its traditional role in regulated splicing, we show that PTB has a previously undocumented function in the regulation of microRNA functions, suppressing or enhancing microRNA targeting by competitive binding on target mRNA or altering local RNA secondary structure. A key event during neuronal induction is the relief of PTB-mediated blockage of microRNA action on multiple components of the REST complex, thereby derepressing a large array of neuronal genes, including miR-124 and multiple neuronal-specific transcription factors, in nonneuronal cells. This converts a negative feedback loop to a positive one to elicit cellular reprogramming to the neuronal lineage.

Here, we show that the leprosy bacterium hijacks this property to reprogram adult Schwann cells, its preferred host niche, to a stage of progenitor/stem-like cells (pSLC) of mesenchymal trait by downregulating Schwann cell lineage/differentiation-associated genes and upregulating genes mostly of mesoderm development. Reprogramming accompanies epigenetic changes and renders infected cells highly plastic, migratory, and immunomodulatory. We provide evidence that acquisition of these properties by pSLC promotes bacterial spread by two distinct mechanisms: direct differentiation to mesenchymal tissues, including skeletal and smooth muscles, and formation of granuloma-like structures and subsequent release of bacteria-laden macrophages. These findings support a model of host cell reprogramming in which a bacterial pathogen uses the plasticity of its cellular niche for promoting dissemination of infection and provide an unexpected link between cellular reprogramming and host-pathogen interaction. º Leprosy bacteria reprogram adult Schwann cells by altering host-gene expression º Bacterially reprogrammed cells resemble progenitor/stem-like cells (pSLC) of mesenchymal trait º pSLC promote bacterial spread to mesenchymal tissues by redifferentiation º pSLC secrete immune factors, recruit macrophages, transfer bacteria, form granulomas, and disseminate infection Masaki et al. discover that leprosy bacteria are able to hijack the plasticity of differentiated adult Schwann cells to reprogram them into a stem cell-like state.

                This investigation was undertaken to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the genotyping error detection function of the computer program SIMWALK2. We chose to examine chromosome 22, which had 7 microsatellite markers, from a single simulated replicate (330 pedigrees with a pattern of missing genotype data similar to the Framingham families). We created genotype errors at five overall frequencies (0.0, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075, and 0.100) and applied SIMWALK2 to each of these five data sets, respectively assuming that the total error rate (specified in the program), was at each of these same five levels. In this data set, up to an assumed error rate of 10\%, only 50\% of the Mendelian-consistent mistypings were found under any level of true errors. And since as many as 70\% of the errors detected were false-positives, blanking suspect genotypes (at any error probability) will result in a reduction of statistical power due to the concomitant blanking of correctly typed alleles. This work supports the conclusion that allowing for genotyping errors within likelihood calculations during statistical analysis may be preferable to choosing an arbitrary cut-off.

It is not as well recognized that when ultrasensitivity and reinforcing feedback loops are present in a spatially distributed system such as the cell plasmamembrane, they may induce bistability and spatial separation of the system into distinct signaling phases. Here we suggest that bistability of ultrasensitive signaling pathways in a diffusive environment provides a basic mechanism to realize cell membrane polarity. Cell membrane polarization is a fundamental process implicated in several basic biological phenomena, such as differentiation, proliferation, migration and morphogenesis of unicellular and multicellular organisms. We describe a simple, solvable model of cell membrane polarization based on the coupling of membrane diffusion with bistable enzymatic dynamics. The model can reproduce a broad range of symmetry-breaking events, such as those observed in eukaryotic directional sensing, the apico-basal polarization of epithelium cells, the polarization of budding and mating yeast, and the formation of Ras nanoclusters in several cell types.}},

                A major goal of developmental biology is to understand the molecular mechanisms whereby genetic signaling networks establish and maintain distinct cell types within multicellular organisms.

We then propose that switch-like network motifs based on positive feedback play a central role in cell-fate choice, and discuss how mathematical modeling can be used to understand and predict the bistable or multistable behavior of such networks.

                Cell signaling systems that contain positive-feedback loops or double-negative feedback loops can, in principle, convert graded inputs into switch-like, irreversible responses. Systems of this sort are termed "bistable". Recently, several groups have engineered artificial bistable systems into Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and have shown that the systems exhibit interesting and potentially useful properties. In addition, two naturally occurring signaling systems, the p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathways in Xenopus oocytes, have been shown to exhibit bistable responses. Here we review the basic properties of bistable circuits, the requirements for construction of a satisfactory bistable switch, and the recent progress towards constructing and analysing bistable signaling systems.

Although gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for stem cell differentiation have been partially identified, the nature of differentiation dynamics and their regulation leading to robust development remain unclear. Herein, using a dynamical system modeling cell approach, we performed simulations of the developmental process using all possible GRNs with a few genes, and screened GRNs that could generate cell type diversity through cell-cell interactions. We found that model stem cells that both proliferated and differentiated always exhibited oscillatory expression dynamics, and the differentiation frequency of such stem cells was regulated, resulting in a robust number distribution. Moreover, we uncovered the common regulatory motifs for stem cell differentiation, in which a combination of regulatory motifs that generated oscillatory expression dynamics and stabilized distinct cellular states played an essential role. These findings may explain the recently observed heterogeneity and dynamic equilibrium in cellular states of stem cells, and can be used to predict regulatory networks responsible for differentiation in stem cell systems.}},

This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the 'relative stabilities' of N attractors (N > 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin–Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.}},

Here, we investigate the possible structures of bistable genetic networks that can allow two identical cells to acquire different fates through cell-cell interactions. Cell-autonomous bistable networks have been previously sampled using an evolutionary algorithm. We extend this evolutionary procedure to take into account interactions between cells. We obtain a variety of simple bistable networks that we classify into major subtypes. Some have long been proposed in the context of lateral inhibition through the Notch-Delta pathway, some have been more recently considered and others appear to be new and based on mechanisms not previously considered. The results highlight the role of posttranscriptional interactions and particularly of protein complexation and sequestration, which can replace cooperativity in transcriptional interactions. Some bistable networks are entirely based on posttranscriptional interactions and the simplest of these is found to lead, upon a single parameter change, to oscillations in the two cells with opposite phases. We provide qualitative explanations as well as mathematical analyses of the dynamical behaviors of various created networks. The results should help to identify and understand genetic structures implicated in cell-cell interactions and differentiation.}},

                The molecular mechanisms governing self-renewal, differentiation, and lineage specification remain unknown. Transcriptional profiling is likely to provide insight into these processes but, as yet, has been confined to "static" molecular profiles of stem and progenitors cells. We now provide a comprehensive, statistically robust, and "dynamic" analysis of multipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells undergoing self-renewal in response to interleukin-3 (IL-3) and multilineage differentiation in response to lineage-affiliated cytokines. Cells undergoing IL-3-dependent proliferative self-renewal displayed striking complexity, including expression of genes associated with different lineage programs, suggesting a highly responsive compartment poised to rapidly execute intrinsically or extrinsically initiated cell fate decisions. A remarkable general feature of early differentiation was a resolution of complexity through the downregulation of gene expression. Although effector genes characteristic of mature cells were upregulated late, coincident with morphological changes, lineage-specific changes in gene expression were observed prior to this, identifying genes which may provide early harbingers of unilineage commitment. Of particular interest were genes that displayed differential behavior irrespective of the lineage elaborated, many of which were rapidly downregulated within 4 to 8 h after exposure to a differentiation cue. These are likely to include genes important in self-renewal, the maintenance of multipotentiality, or the negative regulation of differentiation per se.

Our studies revealed a hierarchy of myeloerythroid progenitors with distinct lineage potentials.

                Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) continuously regenerate the hematologic system, yet few genes regulating this process have been defined. To identify candidate factors involved in differentiation and self-renewal, we have generated an expression database of hematopoietic stem cells and their differentiated progeny, including erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, NK cells, activated and naive T cells, and B cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed HSCs were more transcriptionally active than their progeny and shared a common activation mechanism with T cells. Each cell type also displayed unique biases in the regulation of particular genetic pathways, with Wnt signaling particularly enhanced in HSCs. We identified approximately 100-400 genes uniquely expressed in each cell type, termed lineage "fingerprints." In overexpression studies, two of these genes, Zfp 105 from the NK cell lineage, and Ets2 from the monocyte lineage, were able to significantly influence differentiation toward their respective lineages, demonstrating the utility of the fingerprints for identifying genes that regulate differentiation.

    abstract = {{In this paper we present a multiscale, individual-based simulation environment that integrates CompuCell3D for lattice-based modelling on the cellular level and Bionetsolver for intracellular modelling. CompuCell3D or CC3D provides an implementation of the lattice-based Cellular Potts Model or CPM (also known as the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg or GGH model) and a Monte Carlo method based on the metropolis algorithm for system evolution. The integration of CC3D for cellular systems with Bionetsolver for subcellular systems enables us to develop a multiscale mathematical model and to study the evolution of cell behaviour due to the dynamics inside of the cells, capturing aspects of cell behaviour and interaction that is not possible using continuum approaches. We then apply this multiscale modelling technique to a model of cancer growth and invasion, based on a previously published model of Ramis-Conde et al. (2008) where individual cell behaviour is driven by a molecular network describing the dynamics of E-cadherin and -catenin. In this model, which we refer to as the centre-based model, an alternative individual-based modelling technique was used, namely, a lattice-free approach. In many respects, the GGH or CPM methodology and the approach of the centre-based model have the same overall goal, that is to mimic behaviours and interactions of biological cells. Although the mathematical foundations and computational implementations of the two approaches are very different, the results of the presented simulations are compatible with each other, suggesting that by using individual-based approaches we can formulate a natural way of describing complex multi-cell, multiscale models. The ability to easily reproduce results of one modelling approach using an alternative approach is also essential from a model cross-validation standpoint and also helps to identify any modelling artefacts specific to a given computational approach.}},

We apply our methods to the regulatory network of the segment polarity genes, thus gaining novel insights into the development of gene expression patterns. For example, we show that very short synthesis and decay times can perturb the wild-type pattern. On the other hand, separation of time-scales between pre- and post-translational processes and a minimal prepattern ensure convergence to the wild-type expression pattern regardless of fluctuations.}},

Furthermore, substantial parts of the generated networks are frozen, in the sense that they reach the same state, regardless of initial state. Thus, our ensemble approach suggests that the yeast network shows highly ordered dynamics.}},

It provides graph visualization for tools and web sites in domains such as software engineering, networking, databases, knowledge representation, and bio-informatics. Hundreds of thousands of copies have been distributed under an open source license. The core of Graphviz consists of implementations of various common types of graph layout. These layouts can be used via a C library interface, streambased command line tools, graphical user interfaces and web browsers. Aspects which distinguish the software include a retention of stream-based interfaces in conjunction with a variety of tools for graph manipulation, and support for a wide assortment of graphical features and output formats. The former makes it possible to write high-level programs for querying, modifying and displaying graphs. The latter allows Graphviz to be useful in a wide range of areas, with applications far removed from academic exercises. The algorithms of Graphviz concentrate on static layouts. Dynagraph is a sibling of Graphviz, with algorithms and interactive programs for incremental layout. At the library level, it provides an object-oriented interface for graphs and graph algorithms.}},

@article{Bhattacharya2011Deterministic,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The image of the "epigenetic landscape", with a series of branching valleys and ridges depicting stable cellular states and the barriers between those states, has been a popular visual metaphor for cell lineage specification - especially in light of the recent discovery that terminally differentiated adult cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells or into alternative cell lineages. However the question of whether the epigenetic landscape can be mapped out quantitatively to provide a predictive model of cellular differentiation remains largely unanswered.RESULTS:Here we derive a simple deterministic path-integral quasi-potential, based on the kinetic parameters of a gene network regulating cell fate, and show that this quantity is minimized along a temporal trajectory in the state space of the gene network, thus providing a marker of directionality for cell differentiation processes. We then use the derived quasi-potential as a measure of "elevation" to quantitatively map the epigenetic landscape, on which trajectories flow "downhill" from any location. Stochastic simulations confirm that the elevation of this computed landscape correlates to the likelihood of occurrence of particular cell fates, with well-populated low-lying "valleys" representing stable cellular states and higher "ridges" acting as barriers to transitions between the stable states.CONCLUSIONS:This quantitative map of the epigenetic landscape underlying cell fate choice provides mechanistic insights into the "forces" that direct cellular differentiation in the context of physiological development, as well as during artificially induced cell lineage reprogramming. Our generalized approach to mapping the landscape is applicable to non-gradient gene regulatory systems for which an analytical potential function cannot be derived, and also to high-dimensional gene networks. Rigorous quantification of the gene regulatory circuits that govern cell lineage choice and subsequent mapping of the epigenetic landscape can potentially help identify optimal routes of cell fate reprogramming.}},

@article{Huang2009Cancer,
    abstract = {{Cell lineage commitment and differentiation are governed by a complex gene regulatory network. Disruption of these processes by inappropriate regulatory signals and by mutational rewiring of the network can lead to tumorigenesis. Cancer cells often exhibit immature or embryonic traits and dysregulated developmental genes can act as oncogenes. However, the prevailing paradigm of somatic evolution and multi-step tumorigenesis, while useful in many instances, offers no logically coherent reason for why oncogenesis recapitulates ontogenesis. The formal concept of "cancer attractors", derived from an integrative, complex systems approach to gene regulatory network may provide a natural explanation. Here we present the theory of attractors in gene network dynamics and review the concept of cell types as attractors. We argue that cancer cells are trapped in abnormal attractors and discuss this concept in the light of recent ideas in cancer biology, including cancer genomics and cancer stem cells, as well as the implications for differentiation therapy.}},

The data provide a good resource to uncover causal gene-gene or gene-phenotype relationships and to characterize the dynamic properties of the underlying molecular networks for various biological processes. Several methods have been developed for identifying the molecular mechanisms of regulation of genes from the data, but many of the methods consider static gene expression profiles only. This paper presents a new method for identifying gene regulations from the time-series gene expression data and for visualizing the gene regulations as dynamic gene regulatory networks. The method has been implemented as a program called DRN Builder (Dynamic Regulatory Network Builder; http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/drnbuilder/) and successfully tested on actual gene expression profiles. DRN Builder will be useful for generating potential gene regulatory networks from a large amount of time-series gene expression data and for analyzing the identified networks.}},

@article{Garg2009Modeling,
    abstract = {{Motivation: Understanding gene regulation in biological processes and modeling the robustness of underlying regulatory networks is an important problem that is currently being addressed by computational systems biologists. Lately, there has been a renewed interest in Boolean modeling techniques for gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, due to their deterministic nature, it is often difficult to identify whether these modeling approaches are robust to the addition of stochastic noise that is widespread in gene regulatory processes. Stochasticity in Boolean models of GRNs has been addressed relatively sparingly in the past, mainly by flipping the expression of genes between different expression levels with a predefined probability. This stochasticity in nodes (SIN) model leads to over representation of noise in GRNs and hence non-correspondence with biological observations.}},

                Primary mouse brain cells were cultured with HPRT (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase)-deficient ES (embryonic stem) cells to see if the ES cells could provide cues sufficient to reprogram a pluripotential state. After 5 days of coculture, HPRT-deficient ES cells were killed by selection in HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine) medium. We observed islands of HAT-resistant ES-like cells surrounded by differentiated cells. Cell lines generated from three such "islands" proved to be spontaneous, pluripotential ES-neural hybrids, and gave rise to a chimera following blastocyst injection. Re-expression of the ES-specific gene Foxd3 from somatic-derived chromosomes suggested that the somatic nucleus had been reprogrammed. Our results raise the intriguing possibility that ASCs shown to contribute to multiple tissues in blastocyst-injection studies may not contribute as a result of pluripotency. Instead contributions may arise from spontaneous fusion events in which phenotype is determined by either cytoplasmic dominance, nuclear reprogramming, or both.

    abstract = {{Random Boolean networks (RBNs) were first introduced and used to model regulatory gene networks by Kauffman in 1969 and since then have been frequently used to model networks at various levels of biological organization. The standard model has a characteristic topology in which the network has N genes with an average of K input connections selected at random. We have used RBNs to examine regulatory gene networks with four different topologies, which are characterized by different rank distributions of output connections that vary from uniform to highly skewed. Among these is the topology of the standard model, which is included for purposes of comparison, and a topology with a power-law rank distribution, which is based on recent data for the regulatory gene network of the bacterium Escherichia coli. We also examine effects of bias in the distribution of Boolean functions for the network. The dynamical properties and mutual information of these networks depend not only on their size but also on their topology and Boolean functions. Networks with the more uniform rank distributions exhibit longer lengths of attractors, larger numbers of attractors, and less mutual information. Networks with the more skewed rank distributions have complementary properties. When viewed as biological decision-making networks, those with either the most uniform or the most skewed rank distributions have disadvantageous properties. The intermediate rank distribution exhibited by the regulatory gene network of E. coli avoids these disadvantages.}},

                To determine whether transcriptional reprogramming is capable of reversing the developmental aging of normal human somatic cells to an embryonic state.
                An isogenic system was utilized to facilitate an accurate assessment of the reprogramming of telomere restriction fragment (TRF) length of aged differentiated cells to that of the human embryonic stem (hES) cell line from which they were originally derived. An hES-derived mortal clonal cell strain EN13 was reprogrammed by SOX2, OCT4 and KLF4. The six resulting induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines were surveyed for telomere length, telomerase activity and telomere-related gene expression. In addition, we measured all these parameters in widely-used hES and iPS cell lines and compared the results to those obtained in the six new isogenic iPS cell lines.
                We observed variable but relatively long TRF lengths in three widely studied hES cell lines (16.09-21.1 kb) but markedly shorter TRF lengths (6.4-12.6 kb) in five similarly widely studied iPS cell lines. Transcriptome analysis comparing these hES and iPS cell lines showed modest variation in a small subset of genes implicated in telomere length regulation. However, iPS cell lines consistently showed reduced levels of telomerase activity compared with hES cell lines. In order to verify these results in an isogenic background, we generated six iPS cell clones from the hES-derived cell line EN13. These iPS cell clones showed initial telomere lengths comparable to the parental EN13 cells, had telomerase activity, expressed embryonic stem cell markers and had a telomere-related transcriptome similar to hES cells. Subsequent culture of five out of six lines generally showed telomere shortening to lengths similar to that observed in the widely distributed iPS lines. However, the clone EH3, with relatively high levels of telomerase activity, progressively increased TRF length over 60 days of serial culture back to that of the parental hES cell line.
                Prematurely aged (shortened) telomeres appears to be a common feature of iPS cells created by current pluripotency protocols. However, the spontaneous appearance of lines that express sufficient telomerase activity to extend telomere length may allow the reversal of developmental aging in human cells for use in regenerative medicine.

    abstract = {{
                Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been generated from a variety of somatic cell types via introduction of transcription factors that mediate pluripotency. However, it is unknown that all cell types can be reprogrammed and whether the origin of the parental cell ultimately determines the behavior of the resultant iPS cell line. We sought to determine whether human retinal-pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells could be reprogrammed, and to test the hypothesis that reprogrammed cells retain a "memory" of their origin in terms of propensity for differentiation. We reprogrammed primary fetal RPE cells via lentiviral expression of OCT4, SOX2, LIN28, and Nanog. The iPS cell lines derived from RPE exhibited morphologies similar to human embryonic stem cells and other iPS cell lines, expressed stem cell markers, and formed teratomas-containing derivatives of all three germ layers. To test whether these iPS cells retained epigenetic imprints from the parental RPE cells, we analyzed their propensity for spontaneous differentiation back into RPE after removal of FGF2. We found that some, but not all, iPS lines exhibited a marked preference for redifferentiation into RPE. Our results show that RPE cells can be reprogrammed to pluripotency, and suggest that they often retain a memory of their previous state of differentiation.

While some processes require full 3D analysis, we suggest that others are more naturally described in 2D or 1D. Keeping the dimensionality as low as possible reduces computational time and makes models more intuitively comprehensible; however, the ability to test full 3D models will build greater confidence in models generally and remains an important emerging area of cell biological modeling.}},

Accurate quantification algorithms are required to enhance the understanding of different biological phenomena. We present a novel approach based on image-segmentation of multi-cellular regions in bright field images demonstrating enhanced quantitative analyses and better understanding of cell motility. We present MultiCellSeg, a segmentation algorithm to separate between multi-cellular and background regions for bright field images, which is based on classification of local patches within an image: a cascade of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied using basic image features. Post processing includes additional classification and graph-cut segmentation to reclassify erroneous regions and refine the segmentation. This approach leads to a parameter-free and robust algorithm. Comparison to an alternative algorithm on wound healing assay images demonstrates its superiority. The proposed approach was used to evaluate common cell migration models such as wound healing and scatter assay. It was applied to quantify the acceleration effect of Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) on healing rate in a time lapse confocal microscopy wound healing assay and demonstrated that the healing rate is linear in both treated and untreated cells, and that HGF/SF accelerates the healing rate by approximately two-fold. A novel fully automated, accurate, zero-parameters method to classify and score scatter-assay images was developed and demonstrated that multi-cellular texture is an excellent descriptor to measure HGF/SF-induced cell scattering. We show that exploitation of textural information from differential interference contrast (DIC) images on the multi-cellular level can prove beneficial for the analyses of wound healing and scatter assays. The proposed approach is generic and can be used alone or alongside traditional fluorescence single-cell processing to perform objective, accurate quantitative analyses for various biological applications.}},

These models typically integrate together numerous biological phenomena such as spatially-explicit heterogeneous cells, cell-cell interactions, cell-environment interactions and intracellular gene networks. The recent advent of programming for graphical processing units (GPU) opens up the possibility of developing more integrative, detailed and predictive biological models while at the same time decreasing the computational cost to simulate those models.RESULTS:We construct a 3D model of epidermal development and provide a set of GPU algorithms that executes significantly faster than sequential central processing unit (CPU) code. We provide a parallel implementation of the subcellular element method for individual cells residing in a lattice-free spatial environment. Each cell in our epidermal model includes an internal gene network, which integrates cellular interaction of Notch signaling together with environmental interaction of basement membrane adhesion, to specify cellular state and behaviors such as growth and division. We take a pedagogical approach to describing how modeling methods are efficiently implemented on the GPU including memory layout of data structures and functional decomposition. We discuss various programmatic issues and provide a set of design guidelines for GPU programming that are instructive to avoid common pitfalls as well as to extract performance from the GPU architecture.CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrate that GPU algorithms represent a significant technological advance for the simulation of complex biological models. We further demonstrate with our epidermal model that the integration of multiple complex modeling methods for heterogeneous multicellular biological processes is both feasible and computationally tractable using this new technology. We hope that the provided algorithms and source code will be a starting point for modelers to develop their own GPU implementations, and encourage others to implement their modeling methods on the GPU and to make that code available to the wider community.}},

However, the effective use of mammograms and other patient data to plan treatment has been restricted by our limited understanding of DCIS growth and calcification. We develop a mechanistic, agent-based cell model and apply it to DCIS. Cell motion is determined by a balance of biomechanical forces. We use potential functions to model interactions with the basement membrane and amongst cells of unequal size and phenotype. Each cell's phenotype is determined by genomic/proteomic- and microenvironment-dependent stochastic processes. Detailed "sub-models" describe cell volume changes during proliferation and necrosis; we are the first to account for cell calcification. We introduce the first patient-specific calibration method to fully constrain the model based upon clinically-accessible histopathology data. After simulating 45 days of solid-type DCIS with comedonecrosis, the model predicts: necrotic cell lysis acts as a biomechanical stress relief and is responsible for the linear DCIS growth observed in mammography; the rate of DCIS advance varies with the duct radius; the tumour grows 7-10mm per year--consistent with mammographic data; and the mammographic and (post-operative) pathologic sizes are linearly correlated--in quantitative agreement with the clinical literature. Patient histopathology matches the predicted DCIS microstructure: an outer proliferative rim surrounds a stratified necrotic core with nuclear debris on its outer edge and calcification in the centre. This work illustrates that computational modelling can provide new insight on the biophysical underpinnings of cancer. It may 1-day be possible to augment a patient's mammography and other imaging with rigorously-calibrated models that help select optimal surgical margins based upon the patient's histopathologic data.

    abstract = {{Explaining embryonic development of multicellular organisms requires insight into complex interactions between genetic regulation and physical, generic mechanisms at multiple scales. As more physicists move into developmental biology, we need to be aware of the  ” cultural” differences between the two fields, whose concepts of  ” explanations” and  ” models” traditionally differ: biologists aiming to identify genetic pathways and expression patterns, physicists tending to look for generic underlying principles. Here we discuss how we can combine such biological and physical approaches into a cell-centered approach to developmental biology. Genetic information can only indirectly influence the morphology and physiology of multicellular organisms. DNA translates into proteins and regulatory RNA sequences, which steer the biophysical properties of cells, their response to signals from neighboring cells, and the production and properties of extracellular matrix (ECM). We argue that in many aspects of biological development, cells' inner workings are irrelevant: what matter are the cell's biophysical properties, the signals it emits and its responses to extracellular signals. Thus we can separate questions about genetic regulation from questions about development. First, we ask what effects a gene network has on cell phenomenology, and how it operates. We then ask through which mechanisms such single-cell phenomenology directs multicellular morphogenesis and physiology. This approach treats the cell as the fundamental module of development. We discuss how this cell-centered approach—which requires significant input from computational biophysics—can assist and supplement experimental research in developmental biology. We review cell-centered approaches, focusing in particular on the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), and present the Tissue Simulation Toolkit which implements the CPM.}},

Although four distinguishable DCIS morphologies are recognized, the mechanisms that generate these different morphological classes remain unclear, and consequently the prognostic strength of DCIS classification is not strong. To improve the understanding of the relation between morphology and time course, we have developed a 2D in silico particle model of the growth of DCIS within a single breast duct. This model considers mechanical effects such as cellular adhesion and intra-ductal pressure, and biological features including proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, and cell polarity. Using this model, we find that different regions of parameter space generate distinct morphological subtypes of DCIS, so elucidating the relation between morphology and time course. Furthermore, we find that tumors with similar architectures may in fact be produced through different mechanisms, and we propose future work to further disentangle the mechanisms involved in DCIS progression.}},

    abstract = {{Emergent behaviors of multi-cellular biological systems (MCBS) result from the behaviors of each individual cells and their interactions with other cells and with the environment. Modeling MCBS requires incorporating these complex interactions among the individual cells and the environment. Modeling approaches for MCBS can be grouped into two categories: continuum models and cell-based models. Continuum models usually take the form of partial differential equations, and the model equations provide insight into the relationship among the components in the system. Cell-based models simulate each individual cell behavior and interactions among them enabling the observation of the emergent system behavior. This review focuses on the cell-based models of MCBS, and especially, the technical aspect of the rule-based simulation method for MCBS is reviewed. How to implement the cell behaviors and the interactions with other cells and with the environment into the computational domain is discussed. The cell behaviors reviewed in this paper are division, migration, apoptosis/necrosis, and differentiation. The environmental factors such as extracellular matrix, chemicals, microvasculature, and forces are also discussed. Application examples of these cell behaviors and interactions are presented.}},

Modelling and simulation are computational tools that are invaluable for description, prediction and understanding these mechanisms in a quantitative and integrative way. Therefore the study of biological functions is greatly aided by multi-scale methods that enable the coupling and simulation of models spanning several spatial and temporal scales. Various methods have been developed for solving multi-scale problems in many scientific disciplines, and are applicable to continuum based modelling techniques, in which the relationship between system properties is expressed with continuous mathematical equations or discrete modelling techniques that are based on individual units to model the heterogeneous microscopic elements such as individuals or cells.

Understanding the potential interacting mechanisms underlying such findings, however, is challenging.METHODS:We describe a method to identify the trans-acting drivers of multiple gene co-expression, which reflects the action of regulatory molecules. This method-termed co-regulatory expression quantitative trait locus (creQTL) mapping-allows for evaluation of a more focused set of phenotypes within a clear biological context than conventional eQTL mapping.RESULTS:Applying this method to a study of endometrial cancer revealed regulatory mechanisms supported by the literature: a creQTL between a locus upstream of STARD13/DLC2 and a group of seven IFNbeta-induced genes. This suggests that the Rho-GTPase encoded by STARD13 regulates IFNbeta-induced genes and the DNA damage response.CONCLUSIONS:Because of the importance of IFNbeta in cancer, our results suggest that creQTL may provide a finer picture of gene regulation and may reveal additional molecular targets for intervention.

In this study, an attempt was made to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the aforementioned seed size traits in F 2:3 , F 2:4 and F 2:5 populations from the direct and reciprocal crosses of Lishuizhongzihuang with Nannong 493-1, using multi-QTL joint analysis (MJA) along with composite interval mapping (CIM). A total of 121 main-effect QTL (M-QTL), six environmental effects, eight environment-by-QTL interactions, five cytoplasmic effects and 92 cytoplasm-by-QTL interactions were detected. Fifty-two common M-QTL across MJA and CIM, 21 common M-QTL in more than two populations and 5 M-QTL in all three populations showed the stability of the results. Five M-QTL had higher heritability, greater than 20\%. In addition, 28 cytoplasm-by-QTL and 4 environment-by-QTL interactions were confirmed by CIM. Most M-QTL were clustered in eight chromosomal regions.

@article{Diaz2011Consensus,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:A number of molecular marker linkage maps have been developed for melon (Cucumis melo L.) over the last two decades. However, these maps were constructed using different marker sets, thus, making comparative analysis among maps difficult. In order to solve this problem, a consensus genetic map in melon was constructed using primarily highly transferable anchor markers that have broad potential use for mapping, synteny, and comparative quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, increasing breeding effectiveness and efficiency via marker-assisted selection (MAS).RESULTS:Under the framework of the International Cucurbit Genomics Initiative (ICuGI, http://www.icugi.org webcite), an integrated genetic map has been constructed by merging data from eight independent mapping experiments using a genetically diverse array of parental lines. The consensus map spans 1150 cM across the 12 melon linkage groups and is composed of 1592 markers (640 SSRs, 330 SNPs, 252 AFLPs, 239 RFLPs, 89 RAPDs, 15 IMAs, 16 indels and 11 morphological traits) with a mean marker density of 0.72 cM/marker. One hundred and ninety-six of these markers (157 SSRs, 32 SNPs, 6 indels and 1 RAPD) were newly developed, mapped or provided by industry representatives as released markers, including 27 SNPs and 5 indels from genes involved in the organic acid metabolism and transport, and 58 EST-SSRs. Additionally, 85 of 822 SSR markers contributed by Syngenta Seeds were included in the integrated map. In addition, 370 QTL controlling 62 traits from 18 previously reported mapping experiments using genetically diverse parental genotypes were also integrated into the consensus map. Some QTL associated with economically important traits detected in separate studies mapped to similar genomic positions. For example, independently identified QTL controlling fruit shape were mapped on similar genomic positions, suggesting that such QTL are possibly responsible for the phenotypic variability observed for this trait in a broad array of melon germplasm.CONCLUSIONS:Even though relatively unsaturated genetic maps in a diverse set of melon market types have been published, the integrated saturated map presented herein should be considered the initial reference map for melon. Most of the mapped markers contained in the reference map are polymorphic in diverse collection of germplasm, and thus are potentially transferrable to a broad array of genetic experimentation (e.g., integration of physical and genetic maps, colinearity analysis, map-based gene cloning, epistasis dissection, and marker-assisted selection).}},

@article{Lefevre2010ReactionDiffusion,
    abstract = {{Cortical folding exhibits both reproducibility and variability in the geometry and topology of its patterns. These two properties are obviously the result of the brain development that goes through local cellular and molecular interactions which have important consequences on the global shape of the cortex. Hypotheses to explain the convoluted aspect of the brain are still intensively debated and do not focus necessarily on the variability of folds. Here we propose a phenomenological model based on reaction-diffusion mechanisms involving Turing morphogens that are responsible for the differential growth of two types of areas, sulci (bottom of folds) and gyri (top of folds). We use a finite element approach of our model that is able to compute the evolution of morphogens on any kind of surface and to deform it through an iterative process. Our model mimics the progressive folding of the cortical surface along foetal development. Moreover it reveals patterns of reproducibility when we look at several realizations of the model from a noisy initial condition. However this reproducibility must be tempered by the fact that a same fold engendered by the model can have different topological properties, in one or several parts. These two results on the reproducibility and variability of the model echo the sulcal roots theory that postulates the existence of anatomical entities around which the folding organizes itself. These sulcal roots would correspond to initial conditions in our model. Last but not least, the parameters of our model are able to produce different kinds of patterns that can be linked to developmental pathologies such as polymicrogyria and lissencephaly. The main significance of our model is that it proposes a first approach to the issue of reproducibility and variability of the cortical folding. The anatomical variability of the human brain folds remains an unclear and challenging issue. However it is clear that this variability is the product of the brain development. Several hypotheses coexist for explaining the rapid development of cortical sulci and it is of the highest interest that understanding their variability would improve the comparison of anatomical and functional data across cohorts of subjects. In this article we propose to extend a model of cortical folding based on interactions between growth factors that shape the cortical surface. First the originality of our approach lies in the fact that the surface on which these mechanisms take place is deformed iteratively and engenders geometric patterns that can be linked to cortical sulci. Secondly we show that some statistical properties of our model can reflect the reproducibility and the variability of sulcal structures. At the end we compare different patterns produced by the model to different pathologies of brain development.}},

Our strategy is to test the technical and practical value of our ideas by building hardware and software prototypes and using them as daily tools. Interesting systems are too complex to be evaluated solely in the abstract; extended use allows us to investigate their properties in depth.

Most of the major advances in information systems have come through this strategy, including personal computing, distributed systems, and the Internet. We also perform complementary work of a more mathematical flavor. Some of it is in established fields of theoretical computer science, such as the analysis of algorithms, computational geometry, and logics of programming. Other work explores new ground motivated by problems that arise in our systems research. We have a strong commitment to communicating our results; exposing and testing our ideas in the research and development communities leads to improved understanding.

This paper shows that the compressors used to compute the normalized compression distance are not idempotent in some cases, being strongly skewed with the size of the objects and window size, and therefore causing a deviation in the identity property of the distance if we don't take care that the objects to be compressed fit the windows. The relationship underlying the precision of the distance and the size of the objects has been analyzed for several well-known compressors, and specially in depth for three cases, bzip2, gzip and PPMZ which are examples of the three main types of compressors: block-sorting, Lempel-Ziv, and statistic. 1.

@article{Mazumdar2002How,
    abstract = {{Embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster begins with a rapid series of mitotic nuclear divisions, unaccompanied by cytokinesis, to produce a multi-nucleated single cell embryo, the syncytial blastoderm. The syncytium then undergoes a process of cell formation, in which the individual nuclei become enclosed in individual cells. This process of cellularization involves integrating mechanisms of cell polarity, cell-cell adhesion and a specialized form of cytokinesis. The detailed molecular mechanism, however, is highly complex and, despite extensive analysis, remains poorly understood. Nevertheless, new insights are emerging from recent studies on aspects of membrane polarization and insertion, which show that membrane components from intracellular organelles are involved. In addition, actin and actin-associated proteins have been heavily implicated while new evidence shows that microtubule cytoskeletal elements are mechanistically involved in all aspects of cellularization. This review will draw on both the traditional models and the new data to provide a current perspective on the nature of cellular blastoderm formation in Drosophila melanogaster.

A key property of many self-organized systems is that of criticality: a state of a system in which, on average, perturbations are neither dampened nor amplified, but are propagated over long temporal or spatial scales. Criticality enables the coordination of complex macroscopic behaviors that strike an optimal balance between stability and adaptability. It has long been hypothesized that biological systems are critical. Here, we address this hypothesis experimentally for system-wide gene expression dynamics in the macrophage. To this end, we have developed a method, based on algorithmic information theory, to assess macrophage criticality, and we have validated the method on networks with known properties. Using global gene expression data from macrophages stimulated with a variety of Toll-like receptor agonists, we found that macrophage dynamics are indeed critical, providing the most compelling evidence to date for this general principle of dynamics in biological systems.}},

We demonstrate that it too is a metric and takes values in [0, 1]; hence it may be called the similarity metric. This is a theory foundation for a new general practical tool. We give two distinctive applications in widely divergent areas (the experiments by necessity use just computable approximations to the target notions). First, we computationally compare whole mitochondrial genomes and infer their evolutionary history. This results in a first completely automatic computed whole mitochondrial phylogeny tree.

Inspired by a model of developmental biologist L. Wolpert, we simulate this situation in an evolutionary setting where individuals have to grow into "French flag" patterns. The cells in our model exist in a 2-layer Potts Model physical environment. Controlled by continuous genetic regulatory networks, identical for all cells of one individual, the cells can individually differ in parameters including target volume, shape, orientation, and diffusion. Intercellular communication is possible via secretion and sensing of diffusing morphogens.
Evolved individuals growing from a single cell can develop the French flag pattern by setting up and maintaining asymmetric morphogen gradients - a behavior predicted by several theoretical models.}},

Whereas studies of development and mathematical models of development may offer new insights into the genotype-phenotype map, the challenge is to make them useful at the level of microevolution. Here we report a computational model of mammalian tooth development that combines parameters of genetic and cellular interactions to produce a three-dimensional tooth from a simple tooth primordia. We systematically tinkered with each of the model parameters to generate phenotypic variation and used geometric morphometric analyses to identify, or developmentally ordinate, parameters best explaining population-level variation of real teeth. To model the full range of developmentally possible morphologies, we used a population sample of ringed seals (Phoca hispida ladogensis). Seal dentitions show a high degree of variation, typically linked to the lack of exact occlusion. Our model suggests that despite the complexity of development and teeth, there may be a simple basis for dental variation. Changes in single parameters regulating signalling during cusp development may explain shape variation among individuals, whereas a parameter regulating epithelial growth may explain serial, tooth-to-tooth variation along the jaw. Our study provides a step towards integrating the genotype, development and the phenotype.}},

Little is known, however, of how evolutionary competition among individuals affects biological organization. Here we explore this link in bacterial biofilms, concrete systems that are well known for higher-order structures. We present a mechanistic model of cell growth at a surface, and we show that tension between growth and competition for nutrients can explain how empirically observed patterns emerge in biofilms. We then apply our model to evolutionary simulations and observe that the maintenance of patterns requires cooperation between cells. Specifically, when different genotypes meet and compete, natural selection favors energetically costly spreading strategies, like polymer secretion, that simultaneously reduce productivity and disrupt the spatial patterns. Our theory provides a formal link between higher-level patterning and the potential for evolutionary conflict by showing that both can arise from a single set of scale-dependent processes. Moreover, and contrary to previous theory, our analysis predicts an antagonistic relationship between evolutionary conflict and pattern formation: conflict drives disorder.}},

Discovering drugs that block tumor-induced development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is an important approach in cancer treatment. The complexity of angiogenesis presents both challenges and opportunities for cancer therapies. Intuitive approaches, such as blocking VegF activity, have yielded important therapies. But there maybe opportunities to alter nonintuitive targets either alone or in combination. This paper describes the development of a high-fidelity simulation of angiogenesis and uses this as the basis for a parallel search-based approach for the discovery of novel potential cancer treatments that inhibit blood vessel growth. Discovering new therapies is viewed as a multiobjective combinatorial optimization over two competing objectives: minimizing the estimated cost of practically developing the intervention while minimizing the simulated oxygen provided to the tumor by angiogenesis. Results show the effectiveness of the search process by finding interventions that are currently in use, and more interestingly, discovering potential new approaches that are nonintuitive yet effective.}},

    abstract = {{
                The process of cellular differentiation is governed by complex dynamical biomolecular networks consisting of a multitude of genes and their products acting in concert to determine a particular cell fate. Thus, a systems level view is necessary for understanding how a cell coordinates this process and for developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat diseases, such as cancer, in which differentiation plays a significant role. Theoretical considerations and recent experimental evidence support the view that cell fates are high dimensional attractor states of the underlying molecular networks. The temporal behavior of the network states progressing toward different cell fate attractors has the potential to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms governing differentiation.
                Using the HL60 multipotent promyelocytic leukemia cell line, we performed experiments that ultimately led to two different cell fate attractors by two treatments of varying dosage and duration of the differentiation agent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). The dosage and duration combinations of the two treatments were chosen by means of flow cytometric measurements of CD11b, a well-known early differentiation marker, such that they generated two intermediate populations that were poised at the apparently same stage of differentiation. However, the population of one treatment proceeded toward the terminally differentiated neutrophil attractor while that of the other treatment reverted back toward the undifferentiated promyelocytic attractor. We monitored the gene expression changes in the two populations after their respective treatments over a period of five days and identified a set of genes that diverged in their expression, a subset of which promotes neutrophil differentiation while the other represses cell cycle progression. By employing promoter based transcription factor binding site analysis, we found enrichment in the set of divergent genes, of transcription factors functionally linked to tumor progression, cell cycle, and development.
                Since many of the transcription factors identified by this approach are also known to be implicated in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemia, this study points to the utility of incorporating a dynamical systems level view into a computational analysis framework for elucidating transcriptional mechanisms regulating differentiation.

    abstract = {{The global burden of cancer continues to increase largely because of the aging and growth of the world population alongside an increasing adoption of cancer-causing behaviors, particularly smoking, in economically developing countries. Based on the GLOBOCAN 2008 estimates, about 12.7 million cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths are estimated to have occurred in 2008; of these, 56\% of the cases and 64\% of the deaths occurred in the economically developing world. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23\% of the total cancer cases and 14\% of the cancer deaths. Lung cancer is the leading cancer site in males, comprising 17\% of the total new cancer cases and 23\% of the total cancer deaths. Breast cancer is now also the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries, a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause of cancer death was cervical cancer. Further, the mortality burden for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11\% of the total female cancer deaths. Although overall cancer incidence rates in the developing world are half those seen in the developed world in both sexes, the overall cancer mortality rates are generally similar. Cancer survival tends to be poorer in developing countries, most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis and limited access to timely and standard treatment. A substantial proportion of the worldwide burden of cancer could be prevented through the application of existing cancer control knowledge and by implementing programs for tobacco control, vaccination (for liver and cervical cancers), and early detection and treatment, as well as public health campaigns promoting physical activity and a healthier dietary intake. Clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers can play an active role in accelerating the application of such interventions globally.

A total of 1,596,670 new cancer cases and 571,950 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2011. Overall cancer incidence rates were stable in men in the most recent time period after decreasing by 1.9\% per year from 2001 to 2005; in women, incidence rates have been declining by 0.6\% annually since 1998. Overall cancer death rates decreased in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women from 1998 through 2007, with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. African American and Hispanic men showed the largest annual decreases in cancer death rates during this time period (2.6\% and 2.5\%, respectively). Lung cancer death rates showed a significant decline in women after continuously increasing since the 1930s. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 898,000 deaths from cancer. However, this progress has not benefitted all segments of the population equally; cancer death rates for individuals with the least education are more than twice those of the most educated. The elimination of educational and racial disparities could potentially have avoided about 37\% (60,370) of the premature cancer deaths among individuals aged 25 to 64 years in 2007 alone. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket.

@article{Crampin2002Pattern,
    abstract = {{Recent examples of biological pattern formation where a pattern changes qualitatively as the underlying domain grows have given rise to renewed interest in the reaction-diffusion (Turing) model for pattern formation. Several authors have now reported studies showing that with the addition of domain growth the Turing model can generate sequences of patterns consistent with experimental observations. These studies demonstrate the tendency for the symmetrical splitting or insertion of concentration peaks in response to domain growth. This process has also been suggested as a mechanism for reliable pattern selection. However, thus far authors have only considered the restricted case where growth is uniform throughout the domain. In this paper we generalize our recent results for reaction-diffusion pattern formation on growing domains to consider the effects of spatially nonuniform growth. The purpose is twofold: firstly to demonstrate that the addition of weak spatial heterogeneity does not significantly alter pattern selection from the uniform case, but secondly that sufficiently strong nonuniformity, for example where only a restricted part of the domain is growing, can give rise to sequences of patterns not seen for the uniform case, giving a further mechanism for controlling pattern selection. A framework for modelling is presented in which domain expansion and boundary (apical) growth are unified in a consistent manner. The results have implications for all reaction-diffusion type models subject to underlying domain growth.}},

@article{White2011Flo11p,
    abstract = {{Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown on plastic surfaces formed organized structures, termed minicolonies, that consisted of a core of round (yeast-like) cells surrounded by chains of filamentous cells (pseudohyphae). Minicolonies had a much higher affinity for plastic than unstructured yeast communities growing on the same surface. Pseudohyphae at the surface of these colonies developed further into chains of asci. These structures suggest that pseudohyphal differentiation and sporulation are sequential processes in minicolonies. Consistent with this idea, minicolonies grown under conditions that stimulated pseudohyphal differentiation contained higher frequencies of asci. Furthermore, a flo11Δ mutant, which fails to form pseudohyphae, yielded normal sporulation in cultures, but was defective for minicolony sporulation. When minicolonies were dispersed in water and cells were then allowed to settle on the plastic surface, these cells sporulated very efficiently. Taken together, our results suggest that sporulation in minicolonies is stimulated by pseudohyphal differentiation because these pseudohyphae are dispersed from the core of the colony.}},

@article{Regot2011Distributed,
    abstract = {{Ongoing efforts within synthetic and systems biology have been directed towards the building of artificial computational devices using engineered biological units as basic building blocks. Such efforts, inspired in the standard design of electronic circuits, are limited by the difficulties arising from wiring the basic computational units (logic gates) through the appropriate connections, each one to be implemented by a different molecule. Here, we show that there is a logically different form of implementing complex Boolean logic computations that reduces wiring constraints thanks to a redundant distribution of the desired output among engineered cells. A practical implementation is presented using a library of engineered yeast cells, which can be combined in multiple ways. Each construct defines a logic function and combining cells and their connections allow building more complex synthetic devices. As a proof of principle, we have implemented many logic functions by using just a few engineered cells. Of note, small modifications and combination of those cells allowed for implementing more complex circuits such as a multiplexer or a 1-bit adder with carry, showing the great potential for re-utilization of small parts of the circuit. Our results support the approach of using cellular consortia as an efficient way of engineering complex tasks not easily solvable using single-cell implementations.}},

@article{Turk1991Generating,
    abstract = {{This paper describes a biologically motivated method of texture synthesis called reaction-diffusion and demonstrates how these textures can be generated in a manner that directly matches the geometry of a given surface. Reaction-diffusion is a process in which two or more chemicals diffuse at unequal rates over a surface and react with one another to form stable patterns such as spots and stripes. Biologists and mathematicians have explored the patterns made by several reaction-diffusion systems. We extend the range of textures that have previously been generated by using a cascade of multiple reaction-diffusion systems in which one system lays down an initial pattern and then one or more later systems refine the pattern. Examples of patterns generated by such a cascade process include the clusters of spots on leopards known as rosettes and the web-like patterns found on giraffes. In addition, this paper introduces a method which reaction-diffusion textures are created to match the geometry of an arbitrary polyhedral surface. This is accomplished by creating a mesh over a given surface and then simulating the reaction-diffusion process directly on this mesh. This avoids the often difficult task of assigning texture coordinates to a complex surface. A mesh is generated by evenly distributing points over the model using relaxation and then determining which points are adjacent by constructing their Voronoi regions. Textures are rendered directly from the mesh by using a weighted sum of mesh values to compute surface color at a given position. Such textures can also be used as bump maps.}},

    abstract = {{It is acknowledged that the presence of positive or negative circuits in regulatory networks such as genetic networks is linked to the emergence of significant dynamical properties such as multistability (involved in differentiation) and periodic oscillations (involved in homeostasis). Rules proposed by the biologist R. Thomas assert that these circuits are necessary for such dynamical properties. These rules have been studied by several authors. Their obvious interest is that they relate the rather simple information contained in the structure of the network (signed circuits) to its much more complex dynamical behaviour. We prove in this article a nontrivial converse of these rules, namely that certain positive or negative circuits in a regulatory graph are actually sufficient for the observation of a restricted form of the corresponding dynamical property, differentiation or homeostasis. More precisely, the crucial property that we require is that the circuit be globally minimal. We then apply these results to the vertebrate immune system, and show that the two minimal functional positive circuits of the model indeed behave as modules which combine to explain the presence of the three stable states corresponding to the Th0, Th1 and Th2 cells.

@article{Shmulevich2005Eukaryotic,
    abstract = {{Two important theoretical approaches have been developed to generically characterize the relationship between the structure and function of large genetic networks: The continuous approach, based on reaction-kinetics differential equations, and the Boolean approach, based on difference equations and discrete logical rules. These two approaches do not always coincide in their predictions for the same system. Nonetheless, both of them predict that the highly nonlinear dynamics exhibited by genetic regulatory systems can be characterized into two broad regimes, to wit, an ordered regime where the system is robust against perturbations, and a chaotic regime where the system is extremely sensitive to perturbations. It has been a plausible and long-standing hypothesis that genomic regulatory networks of real cells operate in the ordered regime or at the border between order and chaos. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the robustness and stability observed in the phenotypic traits of living organisms under genetic perturbations. However, there has been no systematic study to determine whether the gene-expression patterns of real cells are compatible with the dynamically ordered regimes predicted by theoretical models. Using the Boolean approach, here we show what we believe to be the first direct evidence that the underlying genetic network of HeLa cells appears to operate either in the ordered regime or at the border between order and chaos but does not appear to be chaotic.}},

Using methods employed by chemists and engineers in modeling hierarchical systems, I have integrated current theory and experiment into a calculational method that can model earlyDrosophilaembryogenesis on a personal computer. This quantitative calculation tool is simple enough to be useful for experimentalists in designing experiments yet detailed enough for theoreticians to derive new insights on the evolution of developmental genetic networks. By integrating the strengths of theoretical and experimental methods into a single engineering model that can compute the cascade of genetic networks in a real organism, I provide a new calculational tool that can apply current theory to current experimental data to study the evolution of developmental programs.}},

@article{Kauffman1991Coevolution,
    abstract = {{We introduce a broadened framework to study aspects of coevolution based on the NKclass of statistical models of rugged fitness landscapes. In these models the fitness contribution of each of Ngenes in a genotype depends epistatically on Kother genes. Increasing epistatic interactions increases the rugged multipeaked character of the fitness landscape. Coevolution is thought of, at the lowest level, as a coupling of landscapes such that adaptive moves by one player deform the landscapes of its immediate partners. In these models we are able to tune the ruggedness of landscapes, how richly intercoupled any two landscapes are, and how many other players interact with each player. All these properties profoundly alter the character of the coevolutionary dynamics. In particular, these parameters govern how readily coevolving ecosystems achieve Nash equilibria, how stable to perturbations such equilibria are, and the sustained mean fitness of coevolving partners. In turn, this raises the possibility that an evolutionary metadynamicsdue to natural selection may sculpt landscapes and their couplings to achieve coevolutionary systems able to coadapt well. The results suggest that sustained fitness is optimized when landscape ruggedness relative to couplings between landscapes is tuned such that Nash equilibria just tenuously form across the ecosystem. In this poised state, coevolutionary avalanches appear to propagate on all length scales in a power law distribution. Such avalanches may be related to the distribution of small and large extinction events in the record.}},

@article{Kitzbichler2009Broadband,
    abstract = {{Self-organized criticality is an attractive model for human brain dynamics, but there has been little direct evidence for its existence in large-scale systems measured by neuroimaging. In general, critical systems are associated with fractal or power law scaling, long-range correlations in space and time, and rapid reconfiguration in response to external inputs. Here, we consider two measures of phase synchronization: the phase-lock interval, or duration of coupling between a pair of (neurophysiological) processes, and the lability of global synchronization of a (brain functional) network. Using computational simulations of two mechanistically distinct systems displaying complex dynamics, the Ising model and the Kuramoto model, we show that both synchronization metrics have power law probability distributions specifically when these systems are in a critical state. We then demonstrate power law scaling of both pairwise and global synchronization metrics in functional MRI and magnetoencephalographic data recorded from normal volunteers under resting conditions. These results strongly suggest that human brain functional systems exist in an endogenous state of dynamical criticality, characterized by a greater than random probability of both prolonged periods of phase-locking and occurrence of large rapid changes in the state of global synchronization, analogous to the neuronal "avalanches" previously described in cellular systems. Moreover, evidence for critical dynamics was identified consistently in neurophysiological systems operating at frequency intervals ranging from 0.05-0.11 to 62.5-125 Hz, confirming that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brain's physiological bandwidth.}},

In addition to the ubiquitous epithelial cell polarity along the apical-basolateral axis, many epithelial tissues and organs are also polarized within the plane of the epithelium. This is generally referred to as planar cell polarity (PCP; or historically, tissue polarity). Genetic screens in Drosophila pioneered the discovery of core PCP factors, and subsequent work in vertebrates has established that the respective pathways are evolutionarily conserved. PCP is not restricted only to epithelial tissues but is also found in mesenchymal cells, where it can regulate cell migration and cell intercalation. Moreover, particularly in vertebrates, the conserved core PCP signaling factors have recently been found to be associated with the orientation or formation of cilia. This review discusses new developments in the molecular understanding of PCP establishment in Drosophila and vertebrates; these developments are integrated with new evidence that links PCP signaling to human disease.}},

The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is known to exhibit a stage-dependent cell division. Daughter cell, which gives no birth, has longer generation time than mother, because daughter needs maturity time. So far, investigations have been restricted in exponential or non-crowding state; very little is known for the stage dependence of density effect. Here we present a lattice gas model to explore the population dynamics of crowding period. We compare theoretical results with experimental data, and find a stage-dependent density effect. Although small daughter cells can develop to a critical size, the reproduction of large daughter cells suddenly stops when the total density exceeds some critical level. Our results imply the existence of an inhibitor that specifically halts the reproduction of matured daughter cell.}},

@article{Dinh2008Adaptation,
    abstract = {{Microorganisms can adapt to perturbations of the surrounding environment to grow. To analyze the adaptation process of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a high ethanol concentration, repetitive cultivation was performed with a stepwise increase in the ethanol concentration in the culture medium. First, a laboratory strain of S. cerevisiae was cultivated in medium containing a low ethanol concentration, followed by repetitive cultivations. Then, the strain repeatedly cultivated in the low ethanol concentration was transferred to medium containing a high ethanol concentration and cultivated repeatedly in the same high-ethanol-concentration medium. When subjected to a stepwise increase in ethanol concentration with the repetitive cultivations, the yeast cells adapted to the high ethanol concentration; the specific growth rate of the adapted yeast strain did not decrease during repetitive cultivation in the medium containing the same ethanol concentration, while that of the non-adapted strain decreased during repetitive cultivation. A comparison of the fatty acid composition of the cell membrane showed that the contents in oleic acid (C18:1) in ethanol-adapted and non-adapted strains were similar, but the content of palmitic acid (C16:0) in the ethanol-adapted strains was lower than that in the non-adapted strain in media containing ethanol. Moreover, microscopic observation showed that the mother cells of the adapted yeast were significantly larger than those of the non-adapted strain. Our results suggest that activity of cell growth defined by specific growth rate of the yeast cells adapted to stepwise increase in ethanol concentration did not decrease during repetitive cultivation in high-ethanol-concentration medium. Moreover, fatty acid content of cell membrane and the size of ethanol-adapted yeast cells were changed during adaptation process. Those might be the typical phenotypes of yeast cells adapted to high ethanol concentration. In addition, the difference in sizes of the mother cell between the non-adapted and ethanol strains suggests that the cell size, cell cycle and adaptation to ethanol are thought to be closely correlated.}},

The change of the gel refractive index caused by the change of the diffusing solute concentration in the gel during the diffusion process enables the effective solute diffusion coefficients to be computed. The change in glucose concentration in agarose gel with the diffusion distance and the diffusion kinetics of glucose in agarose gels reveal that glucose diffuses freely within these gel matrixes with a high diffusion coefficient ?6 ? 10-10 m2/s for 0.5\% and 1.5\% agarose gels. However, the diffusion coefficients of PEGs in the gel are generally in the range of (0.7?5.9) ? 10-10 m2/s and decrease with an increase in the network density (higher agarose gel concentration) and/or in the molecular weight of the diffusing solutes. It is observed that the molecular weight dependence of the PEG diffusion coefficients can be described with a power law expression with an exponent ?0.533, indicating that PEG in agarose gel is in a situation close to the negligible solvent drainage coil (exhibited in dilute solution with a characteristic exponent ?0.5). Furthermore, two models of both Ogston's model and Amsden's model based on the obstruction effect were used to simulate the effect of polymer volume fraction on the diffusion coefficients of the solutes in agarose gel to account for the results.}},

This uses a novel speed term based on local phase and local orientation derived from the monogenic signal, which renders the algorithm invariant to intensity, making it ideal for these images. The new method can robustly handle noise and local minima, and distinguish touching cells. Validation is shown against manual expert segmentations.}},

                We formulate a theoretical model to analyze the vascular remodelling process of an arterio-venous vessel network during solid tumour growth. The model incorporates a hierarchically organized initial vasculature comprising arteries, veins and capillaries, and involves sprouting angiogenesis, vessel cooption, dilation and regression as well as tumour cell proliferation and death. The emerging tumour vasculature is non-hierarchical, compartmentalized into well-characterized zones and transports efficiently an injected drug-bolus. It displays a complex geometry with necrotic zones and "hot spots" of increased vascular density and blood flow of varying size. The corresponding cluster size distribution is algebraic, reminiscent of a self-organized critical state. The intra-tumour vascular-density fluctuations correlate with pressure drops in the initial vasculature suggesting a physical mechanism underlying hot spot formation.

    abstract = {{
                The functional properties of microcirculation crucially depend on its angioarchitecture, (i.e., vessel arrangement and morphology). The microcirculation is subject to continuous dynamic structural adaptation (i.e., remodeling) controlled by hemodynamic and metabolic stimuli. Due to the complexity of the interactions among stimuli, reactions, and functional properties, an adequate understanding of structural adaptation requires mathematical models in addition to experimental investigations. Mathematical models have been developed that allow the prediction of realistic vascular properties, based on generic patterns of vascular responses. These models can be used to investigate and predict distributions of vessel morphology consistent with certain putative adaptation principles of terminal vascular beds in response to local hemodynamic and metabolic conditions. They have suggested new hypotheses, including the importance of conducted responses in network adaptation, and can explain the mechanisms underlying observed structural and functional network properties. In the future, the value of such models can be enhanced by including the effects of longitudinal stretch and pulsatility, the relationship between acute tone and structural adaptation, and the description of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying structural responses of microvessels.

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Cilibrasi2005Clustering,
    abstract = {{We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method does not use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a parameter-free, universal, similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal. However, the optimality comes at the price of using the noncomputable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose axioms to capture the real-world setting, and show that the NCD approximates optimality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (ternary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics, we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.}},

Molecular channels to facilitate cell-cell transfer of nutrients and signaling molecules appear to be critical, as this trait occurs in all complex multicellular organisms but few others. Proliferation of gene families for transcription factors and cell signals accompany the key functional innovation of complex multicellular clades: differentiated cells and tissues for the bulk transport of oxygen, nutrients, and molecular signals that enable organisms to circumvent the physical limitations of diffusion. The fossil records of animals and plants document key stages of this trajectory.}},

                The wound healing assay is a commonly used technique to measure cell motility and migration. Traditional methods of performing the wound healing assay suffer from low throughput and a lack of quantitative data analysis. We have developed a new method to perform a high-throughput wound healing assay that produces quantitative data using the LEAP™ instrument. The LEAP™ instrument is used to create reproducible wounds in each well of a 96-well plate by laser ablation. The LEAP™ then records bright field images of each well at several time points. A custom texture segmentation algorithm is used to determine the wound area of each well at each time point. This texture segmentation analysis can provide faster and more accurate image analysis than traditional methods. Experimental results show that reproducible wounds are created by laser ablation with a wound area that varies by less than 10\%. This method was tested by confirming that neuregulin-2β increases the rate of wound healing by MCF7 cells in a dose dependent manner. This automated wound healing assay has greatly improved the speed and accuracy, making it a suitable high-throughput method for drug screening.

SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way.

    abstract = {{We generalize random Boolean networks by softening the hard binary discretization into multiple discrete states. These multistate networks are generic models of gene regulatory networks, where each gene is known to assume a finite number of functionally different expression levels. We analytically determine the critical connectivity that separates the biologically unfavorable frozen and chaotic regimes. This connectivity is inversely proportional to a parameter which measures the heterogeneity of the update rules. Interestingly, the latter does not necessarily increase with the mean number of discrete states per node. Still, allowing for multiple states decreases the critical connectivity as compared to random Boolean networks, and thus leads to biologically unrealistic situations. Therefore, we study two approaches to increase the critical connectivity. First, we demonstrate that each network can be kept in its frozen regime by sufficiently biasing the update rules. Second, we restrict the randomly chosen update rules to a subclass of biologically more meaningful functions. These functions are characterized based on a thermodynamic model of gene regulation. We analytically show that their usage indeed increases the critical connectivity. From a general point of view, our thermodynamic considerations link discrete and continuous models of gene regulatory networks.}},

A systems view on the interactions of core transcription factors is important for understanding differentiation mechanisms and dynamics. In this manuscript, we construct a Boolean network to model myeloid differentiation, specifically from common myeloid progenitors to megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. By interpreting the hematopoietic literature and translating experimental evidence into Boolean rules, we implement binary dynamics on the resulting 11-factor regulatory network. Our network contains interesting functional modules and a concatenation of mutual antagonistic pairs. The state space of our model is a hierarchical, acyclic graph, typifying the principles of myeloid differentiation. We observe excellent agreement between the steady states of our model and microarray expression profiles of two different studies. Moreover, perturbations of the network topology correctly reproduce reported knockout phenotypes in silico. We predict previously uncharacterized regulatory interactions and alterations of the differentiation process, and line out reprogramming strategies.}},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal development and environmental resistance of biofilms and colonies remain largely unknown. In this paper, we show that a biofilm yeast colony is a finely tuned, complex multicellular organism in which specialized cells jointly execute multiple protection strategies. These include a Pdr1p-regulated mechanism whereby multidrug resistance transporters Pdr5p and Snq2p expel external compounds solely within the surface cell layers as well as developmentally regulated production by internal cells of a selectively permeable extracellular matrix. The two mechanisms act in concert during colony development, allowing growth of new cell generations in a well-protected internal cavity of the colony. Colony architecture is strengthened by intercellular fiber connections.}},

Not surprisingly, developmental biology is currently enjoying an influx of ideas and methods from systems biology. This Review highlights current efforts to elucidate design principles underlying the engineering objectives of robustness, precision, and scaling as they relate to the developmental control of growth and pattern formation. Examples from vertebrate and invertebrate development are used to illustrate general lessons, including the value of integral feedback in achieving set-point control; the usefulness of self-organizing behavior; the importance of recognizing and appropriately handling noise; and the absence of ?free lunch.? By illuminating such principles, systems biology is helping to create a functional framework within which to make sense of the mechanistic complexity of organismal development.}},

@article{Melke2010CellBased,
    abstract = {{Although bacteria are unicellular organisms, they have the ability to act in concert by synthesizing and detecting small diffusing autoinducer molecules. The phenomenon, known as quorum sensing, has mainly been proposed to serve as a means for cell-density measurement. Here, we use a cell-based model of growing bacterial microcolonies to investigate a quorum-sensing mechanism at a single cell level. We show that the model indeed predicts a density-dependent behavior, highly dependent on local cell-clustering and the geometry of the space where the colony is evolving. We analyze the molecular network with two positive feedback loops to find the multistability regions and show how the quorum-sensing mechanism depends on different model parameters. Specifically, we show that the switching capability of the network leads to more constraints on parameters in a natural environment where the bacteria themselves produce autoinducer than compared to situations where autoinducer is introduced externally. The cell-based model also allows us to investigate mixed populations, where non-producing cheater cells are shown to have a fitness advantage, but still cannot completely outcompete producer cells. Simulations, therefore, are able to predict the relative fitness of cheater cells from experiments and can also display and account for the paradoxical phenomenon seen in experiments; even though the cheater cells have a fitness advantage in each of the investigated groups, the overall effect is an increase in the fraction of producer cells. The cell-based type of model presented here together with high-resolution experiments will play an integral role in a more explicit and precise comparison of models and experiments, addressing quorum sensing at a cellular resolution. Unicellular organisms have the ability to communicate with each other via signaling molecules, leading to correlated behaviors resembling that of higher organisms. This process, called quorum sensing, allows the cells to monitor the population size or density in a decentralized fashion and perform a common task when these parameters exceed predefined threshold values. The quorum sensing mechanism has been implicated in diverse functions such as producing bioluminescence, virulence factors, and initiating biofilm formation. Complex emergent behaviors, such as quorum sensing, can be hard to analyze and understand without the assistance of mathematical and computational models. Here, we present a cell-based model of proliferating bacterial microcolonies and investigate how population-level responses can emerge from the signaling and mechanical properties of individual cells. We study both signaling variations within homogeneous (homotypic) bacterial populations as well as signaling and competition in mixed heterotypic populations. We investigate in particular how population size, local cell density, and spatial confinement affect colony growth and predict strategies for facilitating quorum sensing. We also show that the interplay between  ” honest” quorum sensing signal producing bacteria and non-producing  ” cheaters” can lead to emergent feedback regulation via differentiated growth that provides only a transient benefit for cheating cells.}},

    abstract = {{Even relatively simple species have evolved mechanisms to organize individual organisms into communities, such that the fitness of the group is greater than the fitness of isolated individuals. Within the fungal kingdom, the ability of many yeast species to organize into communities is crucial for their growth and survival, and this property has important impacts both on the economy and on human health. Over the last few years, studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed several fundamental properties of yeast communities. First, strain-to-strain variation in the structures of these groups is attributable in part to variability in the expression and functions of adhesin proteins. Second, the extracellular matrix surrounding these communities can protect them from environmental stress and may also be important in cell signaling. Finally, diffusible signals between cells contribute to community organization so that different regions of a community express different genes and adopt different cell fates. These findings provide an arena in which to view fundamental mechanisms by which contacts and signals between individual organisms allow them to assemble into functional communities.}},

    abstract = {{The detection and segmentation of adherent eukaryotic cells from brightfield microscopy images represent challenging tasks in the image analysis field. This paper presents a free and open-source image analysis package which fully automates the tasks of cell detection, cell boundary segmentation, and nucleus segmentation in brightfield images. The package also performs image registration between brightfield and fluorescence images. The algorithms were evaluated on a variety of biological cell lines and compared against manual and fluorescence-based ground truths. When tested on HT1080 and HeLa cells, the cell detection step was able to correctly identify over 80\% of cells, whilst the cell boundary segmentation step was able to segment over 75\% of the cell body pixels, and the nucleus segmentation step was able to correctly identify nuclei in over 75\% of the cells. The algorithms for cell detection and nucleus segmentation are novel to the field, whilst the cell boundary segmentation algorithm is contrast-invariant, which makes it more robust on these low-contrast images. Together, this suite of algorithms permit brightfield microscopy image processing without the need for additional fluorescence images. Finally our sephaCe application, which is available at http://www.sephace.com, provides a novel method for integrating these methods with any motorised microscope, thus facilitating the adoption of these techniques in biological research labs.}},

Such switching elements allow to turn a graded input signal into an all-or-nothing output. Traditional studies have focused on this bistable picture of regulation, but higher-order scenarios involving tristable and tetrastable states are possible too. Are these multiswitches allowed in simple gene regulatory networks? Are they likely to be observed? If not, why not? In this paper we present the examination of this question by means of a simple but powerful geometric approach. We examine the relation between multistability, the degree of multimerization of the regulators and the role of autoloops within a deterministic setting, finding that N-stable circuits are possible, although their likelihood to occur rapidly decays with the order of the switch. Our work indicates that, despite two-component circuits are able to implement multistability, they are optimal for Boolean switches. The evolutionary implications are outlined.}},

Sets of random molecular sequences or identically repeated sequences, for example, would be expected to contribute little or no useful information to a cell. This issue of quantitation of information is important since the ebb and flow of biologically significant information is essential to our quantitative understanding of biological function and evolution. Motivated specifically by these problems of biological information, a class of measures is proposed to quantify the contextual nature of the information in sets of objects, based on Kolmogorov's intrinsic complexity. Such measures discount both random and redundant information and are inherent in that they do not require a defined state space to quantify the information. The maximization of this new measure, which can be formulated in terms of the universal information distance, appears to have several useful and interesting properties, some of which we illustrate with examples.}},

This apparent paradox, however, is naturally explained by the rugged "epigenetic landscape" with valleys representing "preprogrammed" attractor states that emerge from the dynamical constraints of the gene regulatory network. This article provides a pedagogical primer to the fundamental principles of gene regulatory networks as integrated dynamic systems and reviews recent insights in gene expression noise and fate determination, thereby offering a formal framework that may help us to understand why cell fate reprogramming events are inherently rare and yet so robust.}},

Given the concept of "ergodic set" as a set of states from which the system, once entering, does not leave when subject to internal noise, first, using the Boolean network model, we show that if all nodes of states on attractors are subject to internal state change with a probability p due to noise, multiple ergodic sets are very unlikely. Thereafter, we show that if a fraction of those nodes are "locked" (not subject to state fluctuations caused by internal noise), multiple ergodic sets emerge. Finally, we present an example of a gene network, modelled with a realistic model of transcription and translation and gene-gene interaction, driven by a stochastic simulation algorithm with multiple time-delayed reactions, which has internal noise and that we also subject to external perturbations. We show that, in this case, two distinct ergodic sets exist and are stable within a wide range of parameters variations and, to some extent, to external perturbations.}},

These can be very interesting models, since one does not have to assume any functionality or particular connectivity of the networks to study their generic properties. Like this, RBNs have been used for exploring the configurations where life could emerge. The fact that RBNs are a generalization of cellular automata makes their research a very important topic. The tutorial, intended for a broad audience, presents the state of the art in RBNs, spanning over several lines of research carried out by different groups. We focus on research done within artificial life, as we cannot exhaust the abundant research done over the decades related to RBNs.}},

@book{Shmulevich2009Probabilistic,
    abstract = {{This is the first comprehensive treatment of probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs), an important model class for studying genetic regulatory networks. This book covers basic model properties, including the relationships between network structure and dynamics, steady-state analysis, and relationships to other model classes. It also discusses the inference of model parameters from experimental data and control strategies for driving network behavior towards desirable states. The PBN model is well suited to serve as a mathematical framework to study basic issues dealing with systems-based genomics, specifically, the relevant aspects of stochastic, nonlinear dynamical systems. The book builds a rigorous mathematical foundation for exploring these issues, which include long-run dynamical properties and how these correspond to therapeutic goals; the effect of complexity on model inference and the resulting consequences of model uncertainty; altering network dynamics via structural intervention, such as perturbing gene logic; optimal control of regulatory networks over time; limitations imposed on the ability to achieve optimal control owing to model complexity; and the effects of asynchronicity. The authors attempt to unify different strands of current research and address emerging issues such as constrained control, greedy control, and asynchronicity. Audience: Researchers in mathematics, computer science, and engineering are exposed to important applications in systems biology and presented with ample opportunities for developing new approaches and methods. The book is also appropriate for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and scientists working in the fields of computational biology, genomic signal processing, control and systems theory, and computer science.

@book{Kauffman1993Origins,
    abstract = {{Stuart Kauffman here presents a brilliant new paradigm for evolutionary biology, one that extends the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order that is widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self-organization plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection. Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood, as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows how complex systems, contrary to expectations, can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues. Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biological science itself will evolve. The work is written for all those interested in the cutting edge of research in the life sciences.}},

@article{Albert2003Topology,
    abstract = {{Expression of the Drosophila segment polarity genes is initiated by a prepattern of pair-rule gene products and maintained by a network of regulatory interactions throughout several stages of embryonic development. Analysis of a model of gene interactions based on differential equations showed that wildtype expression patterns of these genes can be obtained for a wide range of kinetic parameters, which suggests that the steady states are determined by the topology of the network and the type of regulatory interactions between components, not the detailed form of the rate laws. To investigate this, we propose and analyze a Boolean model of this network which is based on a binary ON/OFF representation of transcription and protein levels, and in which the interactions are formulated as logical functions. In this model the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression are determined by the topology of the network and whether components are present or absent, rather than the absolute levels of the mRNAs and proteins and the functional details of their interactions. The model is able to reproduce the wild type gene expression patterns, as well as the ectopic expression patterns observed in over-expression experiments and various mutants. Furthermore, we compute explicitly all steady states of the network and identify the basin of attraction of each steady state. The model gives important insights into the functioning of the segment polarity gene network, such as the crucial role of the wingless and sloppy paired genes, and the network's ability to correct errors in the prepattern.}},

@article{Mendoza2000Genetic,
    abstract = {{The root epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana is formed by alternate files of hair and non-hair cells. Epidermal cells overlying two cortex cells eventually develop a hair, while those overlying only one cortex cell do not. Here we propose a network model that integrates most of the available genetic and molecular data on the regulatory and signaling pathways underlying root epidermal differentiation. The network architecture includes two pathways; one formed by the genes TTG, R homolog, GL2 and CPC, and the other one by the signal transduction proteins ETR1 and CTR1. Both parallel pathways regulate the activity of AXR2 and RHD6, which in turn control the development of root hairs. The regulatory network was simulated as a dynamical system of eight discrete state variables. The distinction between epidermal cells contacting one or two cortical cells was accounted for by fixing the initial states of CPC and ETR1 proteins. The model allows for predictions of mutants and pharmacological effects because it includes the ethylene receptor. The dynamical system reaches one of the six stable states depending upon the initial state of the CPC variable and the ethylene receptor. Two of the stable states describe the activation patterns observed in mature trichoblasts (hair cells) and atrichoblasts (non-hair cells) in the wild-type phenotype and under normal ethylene availability. The other four states correspond to changes in the number of hair cells due to experimentally induced changes in ethylene availability. This model provides a hypothesis on the interactions among genes that encode transcription factors that regulate root hair development and the proteins involved in the ethylene transduction pathway. This is the first effort to use a dynamical system to understand the complex genetic regulatory interactions that rule Arabidopsis primary root development. The advantages of this type of models over static schematic representations are discussed.}},

@article{Soto2004Gene,
    abstract = {{Flowers are icons in developmental studies of complex structures. The vast majority of 250,000 angiosperm plant species have flowers with a conserved organ plan bearing sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels in the center. The combinatorial model for the activity of the so-called ABC homeotic floral genes has guided extensive experimental studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and many other plant species. However, a mechanistic and dynamical explanation for the ABC model and prevalence among flowering plants is lacking. Here, we put forward a simple discrete model that postulates logical rules that formally summarize published ABC and non-ABC gene interaction data for Arabidopsis floral organ cell fate determination and integrates this data into a dynamic network model. This model shows that all possible initial conditions converge to few steady gene activity states that match gene expression profiles observed experimentally in primordial floral organ cells of wild-type and mutant plants. Therefore, the network proposed here provides a dynamical explanation for the ABC model and shows that precise signaling pathways are not required to restrain cell types to those found in Arabidopsis, but these are rather determined by the overall gene network dynamics. Furthermore, we performed robustness analyses that clearly show that the cell types recovered depend on the network architecture rather than on specific values of the model's gene interaction parameters. These results support the hypothesis that such a network constitutes a developmental module, and hence provide a possible explanation for the overall conservation of the ABC model and overall floral plan among angiosperms. In addition, we have been able to predict the effects of differences in network architecture between Arabidopsis and Petunia hybrida.}},

@article{Huang2000ShapeDependent,
    abstract = {{Development of characteristic tissue patterns requires that individual cells be switched locally between different phenotypes or ” fates;” while one cell may proliferate, its neighbors may differentiate or die. Recent studies have revealed that local switching between these different gene programs is controlled through interplay between soluble growth factors, insoluble extracellular matrix molecules, and mechanical forces which produce cell shape distortion. Although the precise molecular basis remains unknown, shape-dependent control of cell growth and function appears to be mediated by tension-dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton. However, the question remains: how can a generalized physical stimulus, such as cell distortion, activate the same set of genes and signaling proteins that are triggered by molecules which bind to specific cell surface receptors. In this article, we use computer simulations based on dynamic Boolean networks to show that the different cell fates that a particular cell can exhibit may represent a preprogrammed set of common end programs or ” attractors” which self-organize within the cell's regulatory networks. In this type of dynamic network model of information processing, generalized stimuli (e.g., mechanical forces) and specific molecular cues elicit signals which follow different trajectories, but eventually converge onto one of a small set of common end programs (growth, quiescence, differentiation, apoptosis, etc.). In other words, if cells use this type of information processing system, then control of cell function would involve selection of preexisting (latent) behavioral modes of the cell, rather than instruction by specific binding molecules. Importantly, the results of the computer simulation closely mimic experimental data obtained with living endothelial cells. The major implication of this finding is that current methods used for analysis of cell function that rely on characterization of linear signaling pathways or clusters of genes with common activity profiles may overlook the most critical features of cellular information processing which normally determine how signal specificity is established and maintained in living cells. }},

@article{Aldana2007Robustness,
    abstract = {{Living organisms are robust to a great variety of genetic changes. Gene regulation networks and metabolic pathways self-organize and reaccommodate to make the organism perform with stability and reliability under many point mutations, gene duplications and gene deletions. At the same time, living organisms are evolvable, which means that these kind of genetic perturbations can eventually make the organism acquire new functions and adapt to new environments. It is still an open problem to determine how robustness and evolvability blend together at the genetic level to produce stable organisms that yet can change and evolve. Here we address this problem by studying the robustness and evolvability of the attractor landscape of genetic regulatory network models under the process of gene duplication followed by divergence. We show that an intrinsic property of this kind of networks is that, after the divergence of the parent and duplicate genes, with a high probability the previous phenotypes, encoded in the attractor landscape of the network, are preserved and new ones might appear. The above is true in a variety of network topologies and even for the case of extreme divergence in which the duplicate gene bears almost no relation with its parent. Our results indicate that networks operating close to the so-called "critical regime" exhibit the maximum robustness and evolvability simultaneously.}},

@article{Shmulevich2002Probabilistic,
    abstract = {{Motivation: Our goal is to construct a model for genetic regulatory networks such that the model class: (i) incorporates rule-based dependencies between genes; (ii) allows the systematic study of global network dynamics; (iii) is able to cope with uncertainty, both in the data and the model selection; and (iv) permits the quantification of the relative influence and sensitivity of genes in their interactions with other genes.Results: We introduce Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN) that share the appealing rule-based properties of Boolean networks, but are robust in the face of uncertainty. We show how the dynamics of these networks can be studied in the probabilistic context of Markov chains, with standard Boolean networks being special cases. Then, we discuss the relationship between PBNs and Bayesian networks—a family of graphical models that explicitly represent probabilistic relationships between variables. We show how probabilistic dependencies between a gene and its parent genes, constituting the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks, can be obtained from PBNs. Finally, we present methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other genes, within the context of PBNs. Examples illustrating the above concepts are presented throughout the paper.Contact: is@ieee.org}},

@article{Gardner2000Construction,
    abstract = {{It has been proposed1 that gene-regulatory circuits with virtually any desired property can be constructed from networks of simple regulatory elements. These properties, which include multistability and oscillations, have been found in specialized gene circuits such as the bacteriophage switch2 and the Cyanobacteria circadian oscillator3. However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch—a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network—in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.}},

As the mat grows, it forms two visually distinct populations called the rim (edge of the mat) and the hub (interior of the mat), which can be physically separated from one another based on their agar adherence properties. Here, we show that growth of the mat on a semisolid agar surface creates concentric glucose and pH gradients in the medium that are required for the differentiation of the hub and rim. Disruption of the pathways that respond to changing levels of glucose block mat formation by decreasing FLO11 expression. However, in wild-type cells, Flo11p is expressed in both portions of the structure. The difference in adherence between the rim and hub appears to be a consequence of the reduced adherence of Flo11p at the elevated pH of the rim.}},

Here, the integration of a spatiotemporal single cell lab-on-a-chip system with an automated cultivation device allows single cell analysis under defined growth conditions and, especially, semiautomated cell retrieval and growth kinetic analysis of the single cell descendants. Performance of the new platform was evaluated using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast was singularized in the lab-on-a-chip (Envirostat), which combines the possibility of cell cultivation with cell analysis. Singularized cells were collected in a microtiter plate and cultivated in a semiautomated cultivation device (Bioscreen C). S. cerevisiae showed highly reproducible and glucose concentration independent growth kinetics in population experiments. Yet, growth kinetics in cultures inoculated with only one or few cells exhibited strong variations, because of an unexpected growth phenotype: colony formation in submerse cultures. Interestingly, the colony-like structures grew for more then 60 h and were stable for at least 82 h, despite rigorous shaking. Cell agglomeration due to pseudohyphal growth could be excluded, suggesting changes in cell wall properties of yeast populations starting from a single yeast. Single cell analysis still exhibits unexpected obstacles. Nevertheless, this new single cell analysis platform can be used for studying cellular dynamics of single cells and expanded cell populations thereof. {\copyright} 2008 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry}},

The results of the simulations were compared with results of <i>in vivo</i> wrinkling experiments performed on the volar forearm. The proposed three-layer skin model simulates wrinkling more realistically than models of fewer layers. The size of the wrinkles predicted by the model fell within the range of the wrinkle sizes measured in the experiments. The maximum range and average roughness differed by 34 and 43\% from the corresponding mean experimental results, respectively. Applications of the model include simulating skin aging, designing more realistic artificial skin and the development of surgical simulators.}},

@article{Ferrer2008Individualbased,
    abstract = {{Micro-organisms play a central role in every ecosystem and in the global biomass cycle. They are strongly involved in many fields of human interest, from medicine to the food industry and waste control. Nevertheless, most micro-organisms remain almost unknown, and nearly 99\% of them have not yet been successfully cultured in vitro. Therefore, new approaches and new tools must be developed in order to understand the collective behaviour of microbial communities in any natural or artificial setting. In particular, theoretical and practical methodologies to deal with such systems at a mesoscopic level of description (covering the range from 100 to 10(8) cells) are required. Individual-based modelling (IBM) has become a widely used tool for describing complex systems made up of autonomous entities, such as ecosystems and social networks. Individual-based models (IBMs) provide some advantages over the traditional whole-population models: (a) they are bottom-up approaches, so they describe the behaviour of a system as a whole by establishing procedural rules for the individuals and for their interactions, and thus allow more realistic assumptions for the model of the individuals than population models do; (b) they permit the introduction of randomness and individual variability, so they can reproduce the diversity found in real systems; and (c) they can account for individual adaptive behaviour to their environmental conditions, so the evolution of the whole system arises from the dynamics that govern individuals in their pursuit of optimal fitness. However, they also present some drawbacks: they lack the clarity of continuous models and may easily become rambling, which makes them difficult to analyse and communicate. All in all, IBMs supply a holistic description of microbial systems and their emerging properties. They are specifically appropriate to deal with microbial communities in non-steady states, and spatially explicit IBMs are particularly appropriate to study laboratory and natural microbiological systems with spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we review IBM methodology applied to microbiology. We also present some results obtained from the application of Individual Discrete Simulations, an IBM of ours, to the study of bacterial communities, yeast cultures and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.}},

@article{Picioreanu2000Effect,
    abstract = {{A two-dimensional model for quantitative evaluation of the effect of convective and diffusive substrate transport on biofilm heterogeneity was developed. The model includes flow computation around the irregular biofilm surface, substrate mass transfer by convection and diffusion, biomass growth, and biomass spreading. It was found that in the absence of detachment, biofilm heterogeneity is mainly determined by internal mass transfer rate of substrates and by the initial percentage of carrier-surface colonization. Model predictions show that biofilm structures with highly irregular surface develop in the mass transfer-limited regime. As the nutrient availability increases, there is a gradual shift toward compact and smooth biofilms. A smaller fraction of colonized carrier surface leads to a patchy biofilm. Biofilm surface irregularity and deep vertical channels are, in this case, caused by the inability of the colonies to spread over the whole substratum surface. The maximum substrate flux to the biofilm was greatly influenced by both internal and external mass transfer rates, but not affected by the inoculation density. In general, results of the present model were similar to those obtained by a simple diffusion–reaction–growth model.  {\copyright} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

@article{Kreft2001Individualbased,
    abstract = {{Understanding the emergence of the complex organization of biofilms from the interactions of its parts, individual cells and their environment, is the aim of the individual-based modelling (IbM) approach. This IbM is version 2 of BacSim, a model of Escherichia coli colony growth, which was developed into a two-dimensional multi-substrate, multi-species model of nitrifying biofilms. It was compared with the established biomass-based model (BbM) of Picioreanu and others. Both models assume that biofilm growth is due to the processes of diffusion, reaction and growth (including biomass growth, division and spreading). In the IbM, each bacterium was a spherical cell in continuous space and had variable growth parameters. Spreading of biomass occurred by shoving of cells to minimize overlap between cells. In the BbM, biomass was distributed in a discrete grid and each species had uniform growth parameters. Spreading of biomass occurred by cellular automata rules. In the IbM, the effect of random variation of growth parameters of individual bacteria was negligible in contrast to the E. coli colony model, because the heterogeneity of substrate concentrations in the biofilm was more important. The growth of a single cell into a clone, and therefore also the growth of the less abundant species, depended on the randomly chosen site of attachment, owing to the heterogeneity of substrate concentrations in the biofilm. The IbM agreed with the BbM regarding the overall growth of the biofilm, due to the same diffusion-reaction processes. However, the biofilm shape was different due to the different biomass spreading mechanisms. The IbM biofilm was more confluent and rounded due to the steady, deterministic and directionally unconstrained spreading of the bacteria. Since the biofilm shape is influenced by the spreading mechanism, it is partially independent of growth, which is driven by diffusion-reaction. Chance in initial attachment events modifies the biofilm shape and the growth of single cells because of the high heterogeneity of substrate concentrations in the biofilm, which again results from the interaction of diffusion-reaction with spreading. This stresses the primary importance of spreading and chance in addition to diffusion-reaction in the emergence of the complexity of the biofilm community.}},

@article{Picioreanu2004ParticleBased,
    abstract = {{In this paper we describe a spatially multidimensional (two-dimensional [2-D] and three-dimensional [3-D]) particle-based approach for modeling the dynamics of multispecies biofilms growing on multiple substrates. The model is based on diffusion-reaction mass balances for chemical species coupled with microbial growth and spreading of biomass represented by hard spherical particles. Effectively, this is a scaled-up version of a previously proposed individual-based biofilm model. Predictions of this new particle-based model were quantitatively compared with those obtained with an established one-dimensional (1-D) multispecies model for equivalent problems. A nitrifying biofilm containing aerobic ammonium and nitrite oxidizers, anaerobic ammonium oxidizers, and inert biomass was chosen as an example. The 2-D and 3-D models generally gave the same results. If only the average flux of nutrients needs to be known, 2-D and 1-D models are very similar. However, the behavior of intermediates, which are produced and consumed in different locations within the biofilm, is better described in 2-D and 3-D models because of the multidirectional concentration gradients. The predictions of 2-D or 3-D models are also different from those of 1-D models for slowly growing or minority species in the biofilm. This aspect is related to the mechanism of biomass spreading or advection implemented in the models and should receive more attention in future experimental studies.}},

@article{BrehmStecher2004SingleCell,
    abstract = {{The field of microbiology has traditionally been concerned with and focused on studies at the population level. Information on how cells respond to their environment, interact with each other, or undergo complex processes such as cellular differentiation or gene expression has been obtained mostly by inference from population-level data. Individual microorganisms, even those in supposedly "clonal" populations, may differ widely from each other in terms of their genetic composition, physiology, biochemistry, or behavior. This genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity has important practical consequences for a number of human interests, including antibiotic or biocide resistance, the productivity and stability of industrial fermentations, the efficacy of food preservatives, and the potential of pathogens to cause disease. New appreciation of the importance of cellular heterogeneity, coupled with recent advances in technology, has driven the development of new tools and techniques for the study of individual microbial cells. Because observations made at the single-cell level are not subject to the "averaging" effects characteristic of bulk-phase, population-level methods, they offer the unique capacity to observe discrete microbiological phenomena unavailable using traditional approaches. As a result, scientists have been able to characterize microorganisms, their activities, and their interactions at unprecedented levels of detail.}},

@article{Kreft1998BacSim,
    abstract = {{Summary: The generic, quantitative, spatially explicit, individual-based model BacSim was developed to simulate growth and behaviour of bacteria. The potential of this approach is in relating the properties of microscopic entities – cells – to the properties of macroscopic, complex systems such as biofilms. Here, the growth of a single Escherichia coli cell into a colony was studied. The object-oriented program BacSim is an extension of Gecko, an ecosystem dynamics model which uses the Swarm toolkit for multi-agent simulations. The model describes bacterial properties including substrate uptake, metabolism, maintenance, cell division and death at the individual cell level. With the aim of making the model easily applicable to various bacteria under different conditions, the model uses as few as eight readily obtainable parameters which can be randomly varied. For substrate diffusion, a two-dimensional diffusion lattice is used. For growth-rate-dependent cell size variation, a conceptual model of cell division proposed by Donachie was examined. A mechanistic version of the Donachie model led to unbalanced growth at higher growth rates, whereas including a minimum period between subsequent replication initiations ensured balanced growth only if this period was unphysiologically long. Only a descriptive version of the Donachie model predicted cell sizes correctly. For maintenance, the Herbert model (constant specific rate of biomass consumption) and for substrate uptake, the Michaelis-Menten or the Best equations were implemented. The simulator output faithfully reproduced all input parameters. Growth characteristics when maintenance and uptake rates were proportional to either cell mass or surface area are compared. The authors propose a new generic measure of growth synchrony to quantify the loss of synchrony due to random variation of cell parameters or spatial heterogeneity. Variation of the maximal uptake rate completely desynchronizes the simulated culture but variation of the volume-at-division does not. A new measure for spatial heterogeneity is introduced: the standard deviation of substrate concentrations as experienced by the cells. Spatial heterogeneity desynchronizes population growth by subdividing the population into parts synchronously growing at different rates. At a high enough spatial heterogeneity, the population appears to grow completely asynchronously.}},

@article{Xavier2007Cooperation,
    abstract = {{Biofilms, in which cells attach to surfaces and secrete slime (polymeric substances), are central to microbial life. Biofilms are often thought to require high levels of cooperation because extracellular polymeric substances are a shared resource produced by one cell that can be used by others. Here we examine this hypothesis by using a detailed individual-based simulation of a biofilm to investigate the outcome of evolutionary competitions between strains that differ in their level of polymer production. Our model includes a biochemical description of the carbon fluxes for growth and polymer production, and it explicitly calculates diffusion–reaction effects and the resulting solute gradients in the biofilm. An emergent property of these simple but realistic mechanistic assumptions is a strong evolutionary advantage to extracellular polymer production. Polymer secretion is altruistic to cells above a focal cell: it pushes later generations in their lineage up and out into better oxygen conditions, but it harms others; polymer production suffocates neighboring nonpolymer producers. This property, analogous to vertical growth in plants, suggests that polymer secretion provides a strong competitive advantage to cell lineages within mixed-genotype biofilms: global cooperation is not required. Our model fundamentally changes how biofilms are expected to respond to changing social conditions; the presence of multiple strains in a biofilm should promote rather than inhibit polymer secretion.}},

@article{Xavier2005Framework,
    abstract = {{Summary Concepts from previous biofilm models were integrated to create a framework for the implementation of multidimensional (2D and 3D) multispecies biofilm models. The framework is here described at three levels: (i) mathematical representation of the processes involved in biofilm formation, (ii) numerical implementation into a computer program (freely available from our website http://www.biofilms.bt.tudelft.nl/frameworkMaterial) and (iii) using the program for the creation of biofilm models with multiple bacterial and solute species. An improved version of the individual-based modelling (IbM) that allows structured biomass was used. In this approach biomass composition may be discriminated into any number of particulate species, including extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) for which specific functionality was included. Detachment is also included, described as occurring at the biofilm surface with variable local rates derived from functions of state variables. The application of this modelling framework to a multispecies system with structured biomass is illustrated in a case study where the competition between an organism capable of accumulating polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB, an internal storage compound) and an EPS-producing organism in a two-species biofilm is analysed. Results illustrate that biofilms enriched in PHB-producing organisms may be obtained by supplying substrate intermittently in feast/famine cycles.}},

This cybernetic model accurately predicts all the key experimentally observed aspects: (i) in batch cultures, duration of the intermediate lag phase, sequential production and consumption of ethanol, and the dynamics of the gaseous exchange rates of oxygen and carbon dioxide; and (ii) in continuous cultures, the spontaneous generation of oscillations as well as the variations in period and amplitude of oscillations when the dilution rate or agitatin rate are changed.}},

    abstract = {{We investigate a three-dimensional multiscale model of vascular tumour growth, which couples blood flow, angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, nutrient/growth factor transport, movement of, and interactions between, normal and tumour cells, and nutrient-dependent cell cycle dynamics within each cell. In particular, we determine how the domain size, aspect ratio and initial vascular network influence the tumour's growth dynamics and its long-time composition. We establish whether it is possible to extrapolate simulation results obtained for small domains to larger ones, by constructing a large simulation domain from a number of identical subdomains, each subsystem initially comprising two parallel parent vessels, with associated cells and diffusible substances. We find that the subsystem is not representative of the full domain and conclude that, for this initial vessel geometry, interactions between adjacent subsystems contribute to the overall growth dynamics. We then show that extrapolation of results from a small subdomain to a larger domain can only be made if the subdomain is sufficiently large and is initialised with a sufficiently complex vascular network. Motivated by these results, we perform simulations to investigate the tumour's response to therapy and show that the probability of tumour elimination in a larger domain can be extrapolated from simulation results on a smaller domain. Finally, we demonstrate how our model may be combined with experimental data, to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of a vascular tumour.}},

@article{Lee2006Epithelialmesenchymal,
    abstract = {{The conversion of an epithelial cell to a mesenchymal cell is critical to metazoan embryogenesis and a defining structural feature of organ development. Current interest in this process, which is described as an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), stems from its developmental importance and its involvement in several adult pathologies. Interest and research in EMT are currently at a high level, as seen by the attendance at the recent EMT meeting in Vancouver, Canada (October 1–3, 2005). The meeting, which was hosted by The EMT International Association, was the second international EMT meeting, the first being held in Port Douglas, Queensland, Australia in October 2003. The EMT International Association was formed in 2002 to provide an international body for those interested in EMT and the reverse process, mesenchymal–epithelial transition, and, most importantly, to bring together those working on EMT in development, cancer, fibrosis, and pathology. These themes continued during the recent meeting in Vancouver.Discussion at the Vancouver meeting spanned several areas of research, including signaling pathway activation of EMT and the transcription factors and gene targets involved. Also covered in detail was the basic cell biology of EMT and its role in cancer and fibrosis, as well as the identification of new markers to facilitate the observation of EMT in vivo. This is particularly important because the potential contribution of EMT during neoplasia is the subject of vigorous scientific debate (Tarin, D., E.W. Thompson, and D.F. Newgreen. 2005. Cancer Res. 65:5996–6000; Thompson, E.W., D.F. Newgreen, and D. Tarin. 2005. Cancer Res. 65:5991–5995).}},

@article{Cap2009Yeast,
    abstract = {{Enzymes scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important for cell protection during stress and aging. A deficiency in these enzymes leads to ROS imbalance, causing various disorders in many organisms, including yeast. In contrast to liquid cultures, where fitness of the yeast population depends on its ROS scavenging capability, the present study suggests that Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells growing in colonies capable of ammonia signaling use a broader protective strategy. Instead of maintaining high levels of antioxidant enzymes for ROS detoxification, colonies activate an alternative metabolism that prevents ROS production. Colonies of the strain deficient in cytosolic superoxide dismutase Sod1p thus developed the same way as wild type colonies. They produced comparable levels of ammonia and underwent similar developmental changes (expression of genes of alternative metabolism and center margin differentiation in ROS production, cell death occurrence, and activities of stress defense enzymes) and did not accumulate stress-resistant suppressants. An absence of cytosolic catalase Ctt1p, however, brought colonies developmental problems, which were even more prominent in the absence of mitochondrial Sod2p. sod2Delta and ctt1Delta colonies failed in ammonia production and sufficient activation of the alternative metabolism and were incapable of center margin differentiation, but they did not increase ROS levels. These new data indicate that colony disorders are not accompanied by ROS burst but could be a consequence of metabolic defects, which, however, could be elicited by imbalance in ROS produced in early developmental phases. Sod2p and homeostasis of ROS may participate in regulatory events leading to ammonia signaling.}},

    abstract = {{Microorganisms in nature form organized multicellular structures (colonies, biofilms) possessing properties absent in individual cells. These are often related to the better ability of communities to survive long-lasting starvation and stress and include mechanisms of adaptation and cell specialization. Thus, yeast colonies pass through distinct developmental phases characterized by changes in pH and the production of ammonia-signalling molecules. Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae colony transition between major developmental phases (first acidic, alkali, second acidic) is accompanied by striking transcription changes, while the development within each particular phase is guided mostly at the post-transcriptional level. First- and second-acidic-phase colonies markedly differ. Second-acidic-phase colonies maintain the adaptive metabolism activated in the ammonia-producing period, supplemented by additional changes, which begin after colonies enter the second acidic phase. Cells with particular properties are not homogenously dispersed throughout the colony population, but localize to specific colony regions. Thus, cells located at the colony margin are able to export higher amounts of ammonium than central cells and to activate an adaptive metabolism. In contrast, central chronologically aged cells are unable to undergo these changes but they maintain higher levels of various stress-defence enzymes. These divergent properties of both cell types determine their consequent dissimilar fate.}},

Understanding the principles involved in the formation of these structures requires new approaches that allow the study of individual cells directly in situ without needing to remove them from the microbial community. Here we introduced a new approach to the analysis of whole yeast microcolonies either containing specific proteins labelled by fluorescent proteins or stained with specific dyes, by two-photon excitation confocal microscopy. It revealed that the colonies are covered with a thin protective skin-like surface cell layer which blocks penetration of harmful compounds. The cells forming the layer are tightly connected via cell walls, the presence of which is essential for keeping of protective layer function. Viewing the colonies from different angles allowed us to reconstruct a three-dimensional profile of the cells producing ammonium exporter Ato1p within developing microcolonies growing either as individuals or within a group of microcolonies. We show that neighbouring microcolonies coordinate production of Ato1p-GFP. Ato1p itself appears synchronously in cells, which do not originate from the same ancestor, but occupy specific position within the colony.}},

    abstract = {{The biochemistry of most metabolic pathways is conserved from bacteria to humans, although the control mechanisms are adapted to the needs of each cell type. Oxygen depletion commonly controls the switch from respiration to fermentation. However, Saccharomyces cerevisiae also controls that switch in response to the external glucose level. We have generated an S. cerevisiae strain in which glucose uptake is dependent on a chimeric hexose transporter mediating reduced sugar uptake. This strain shows a fully respiratory metabolism also at high glucose levels as seen for aerobic organisms, and switches to fermentation only when oxygen is lacking. These observations illustrate that manipulating a single step can alter the mode of metabolism. The novel yeast strain is an excellent tool to study the mechanisms underlying glucose-induced signal transduction.}},

@article{Perumpanani1995Phase,

It is shown that the addition of advection to a two-variable reaction–diffusion system with periodic boundary conditions results in the appearance of a phase difference between the patterns of the two variables which depends on the difference between the advection coefficients. The spatial patterns move like a travelling wave with a fixed velocity which depends on the sum of the advection coefficients. By a suitable choice of advection coefficients, the solution can be made stationary in time. In the presence of advection a continuous change in the diffusion coefficients can result in two Turing-type bifurcations as the diffusion ratio is varied, and such a bifurcation can occur even when the inhibitor species does not diffuse. It is also shown that the initial mode of bifurcation for a given domain size depends on both the advection and diffusion coefficients. These phenomena are demonstrated in the numerical solution of a particular reaction–diffusion system, and finally a possible application of the results to pattern formation in Drosophila larvae is discussed.}},

Methods are needed to formulate biological pathways in a machine-analysable fashion, which would automate the process of considering all possible experiments in a complex pathway and identify those that command attention. In this Essay, we describe a method that is based on the exploitation of computational tools that were originally developed to analyse reactive communicating computer systems such as mobile phones and web browsers. In this approach, the biological process is articulated as an executable computer program that can be interrogated using methods that were developed to analyse complex software systems. Using case studies of the FGF, MAPK and Delta/Notch pathways, we show that the application of this technology can yield interesting insights into the behaviour of signalling pathways, which have subsequently been corroborated by experimental data.}},

@article{Chandrasekaran2010Probabilistic,
    abstract = {{Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene–transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor–target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95\%, and predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95. Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined quantitatively.}},

@article{Walther2004Mathematical,
    abstract = {{In the present study, yeast colony development serves as a model system to study growth of fungal populations with negligible nutrient and signal transport within the mycelium. Mathematical simulations address the question whether colony development is governed by diffusional limitation of nutrients. A hybrid one-dimensional cellular automaton model was developed that describes growth of discrete cells based upon microscopic interaction rules in a continuous field of nutrient and messenger. The model is scaled for the geometry of the experimental setup, cell size, growth- and substrate uptake rates. Therefore, calculated cell density profiles and nutrient distributions can be compared to experimental results and the model assumptions can be verified. In the physiologically relevant parameter range, simulations show an exponentially declining cell density along the median axis of the colonies in case of a diffusion limited growth scenario. These results are in good agreement with cell density profiles obtained in cultivations of the yeast Candida boidinii with glucose as the limiting carbon source but stand in contrast to the constant cell density profile estimated for Yarrowia lipolytica grown under the same conditions. While from the comparison of experimental results and simulations a diffusion limited growth mechanism is proposed for glucose limited C. boidiniicolonies, this hypothesis is rejected for the growth of Y. lipolytica. As an alternative, a quorum sensing model was developed that can explain the evolution of constant cell density profiles based on the effect of a not further characterized unstable or volatile messenger.}},

The problem of sorting unsigned permutation has been proven to be NP-hard. The best guaranteed error bounded is the 3/2approximation algorithm. However, the problem of sorting signed permutation can be solved easily. Fast algorithms have been developed both for finding the sorting sequence and finding the reversal distance of signed permutation. In this paper, we present a way to view the problem of sorting unsigned permutation as signed permutation. And the problem can then be seen as searching an optimal signed permutation in all corresponding signed permutations. We use genetic algorithm to conduct the search. Our experimental result shows that the proposed method outperforms the 3/2-approximation algorithm. 1}},

Surprisingly, HGF accelerates the development of MET amplification both in vitro and in vivo. EGFR kinase inhibitor resistance, due to either MET amplification or autocrine HGF production, was cured in vivo by combined EGFR and MET inhibition. These findings highlight the potential to prospectively identify treatment naive, patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer who will benefit from initial combination therapy. º Rare MET-amplified cells exist in some EGFR-mutant lung cancers before treatment º HGF induces resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in EGFR-addicted cancers º HGF accelerates MET amplification by expanding preexisting MET-amplified cells º Analysis of pretreatment cancers identifies those poised to become MET amplified}},

@article{Jones2008Core,
    abstract = {{There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing probes for approximately 10(6) single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100\% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis.}},

@article{Larson2010Computer,
    abstract = {{We present a computer simulation and associated experimental validation of assembly of glial-like support cells into the interweaving hexagonal lattice that spans the Drosophila pupal eye. This process of cell movements organizes the ommatidial array into a functional pattern. Unlike earlier simulations that focused on the arrangements of cells within individual ommatidia, here we examine the local movements that lead to large-scale organization of the emerging eye field. Simulations based on our experimental observations of cell adhesion, cell death, and cell movement successfully patterned a tracing of an emerging wild-type pupal eye. Surprisingly, altering cell adhesion had only a mild effect on patterning, contradicting our previous hypothesis that the patterning was primarily the result of preferential adhesion between IRM-class surface proteins. Instead, our simulations highlighted the importance of programmed cell death (PCD) as well as a previously unappreciated variable: the expansion of cells' apical surface areas, which promoted rearrangement of neighboring cells. We tested this prediction experimentally by preventing expansion in the apical area of individual cells: patterning was disrupted in a manner predicted by our simulations. Our work demonstrates the value of combining computer simulation with in vivo experiments to uncover novel mechanisms that are perpetuated throughout the eye field. It also demonstrates the utility of the Glazier–Graner–Hogeweg model (GGH) for modeling the links between local cellular interactions and emergent properties of developing epithelia as well as predicting unanticipated results in vivo. During development, organs are assembled through a complex combination of cell proliferation, programmed cell death, cell movements, etc. These aspects of tissue maturation must be achieved with a limited gene set—to achieve complexity, tissues utilize patterning mechanisms. That is,  ” rules” are used to create heterogeneity in initially homogeneous cell populations. A large number of genes and cell biology mechanisms have been uncovered that mediate this process but we have a limited understanding of how these factors act together to generate the large-scale patterns necessary to create a useful organ. Here, we combine computational modeling with in situ experiments in the developing Drosophila eye to explore these issues. Computer modeling is often criticized for describing known outcomes. We demonstrate how the Glazier–Graner–Hogeweg model can successfully predict surprising outcomes contradictory to models that emerged from our previous studies. We then validated these predictions in the developing eye. These mechanisms, which include the importance of dynamic nuclear movements, may prove generally important in directing cells into their proper niches as developing epithelia mature.}},

Recent advances in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy imaging have provided an important tool to study the cell cycle process under different conditions of perturbation. However, existing computational imaging methods are rather limited in analyzing and tracking such time-lapse datasets, and manual analysis is unreasonably time-consuming and subject to observer variances. This paper presents an automated system that integrates a series of advanced analysis methods to fill this gap. The cellular image analysis methods can be used to segment, classify, and track individual cells in a living cell population over a few days. Experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient and effective in cell tracking and phase identification.}},

It is an extension to previously developed measure of similarity (Komosinski et al., Theor Biosci 2001, 120, 271–286) that was only able to consider the structure of 3D constructs. Morphologies are modeled as graphs with vertices as points in a 3D space, and edges connecting these vertices. This model is very general, therefore the proposed algorithm can be applied in (and across) a number of disciplines including artificial life, evolutionary design, engineering, robotics, biology, and chemistry. The primary areas of application of this fast numerical similarity measure are artificial life and evolutionary design, where great numbers of morphologies result from simulated evolutionary processes, and both structural and geometric aspects are significant. Geometry of 3D constructs (i.e., locations of body parts in space) is as important as the structure (i.e., connections of body parts), because both determine behavior of creatures or designs and their fitness in a particular environment. In this work, both morphological aspects are incorporated in a single, highly discriminative measure of similarity. {\copyright} 2011Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    abstract = {{A growing number of screening applications require the automated monitoring of cell populations in a high-throughput, high-content environment. These applications depend on accurate cell tracking of individual cells that display various behaviors including mitosis, merging, rapid movement, and entering and leaving the field of view. Many approaches to cell tracking have been developed in the past, but most are quite complex, require extensive post-processing, and are parameter intensive. To overcome such issues, we present a general, consistent, and extensible tracking approach that explicitly models cell behaviors in a graph-theoretic framework. We introduce a way of extending the standard minimum-cost flow algorithm to account for mitosis and merging events through a coupling operation on particular edges. We then show how the resulting graph can be efficiently solved using algorithms such as linear programming to choose the edges of the graph that observe the constraints while leading to the lowest overall cost. This tracking algorithm relies on accurate denoising and segmentation steps for which we use a wavelet-based approach that is able to accurately segment cells even in images with very low contrast-to-noise. In addition, the framework is able to measure and correct for microscope defocusing and stage shift. We applied the algorithms on nearly 6000 images of 400,000 cells representing 32,000 tracks taken from five separate datasets, each composed of multiple wells. Our algorithm was able to segment and track cells and detect different cell behaviors with an accuracy of over 99\%. This overall framework enables accurate quantitative analysis of cell events and provides a valuable tool for high-throughput biological studies. \^{a}º Generalized graph framework for automatic cell tracking, segmentation, and analysis. \^{a}º Introduced edge coupling approach for handling splitting and merging events. \^{a}º Algorithm handles cell splitting, merging, moving, entering, and leaving the image. \^{a}º Algorithms applied to 6000 images of 400,000 cells and 32,000 tracks. \^{a}º Tracking accuracy of 99.2\% and segmentation precision and recall of 99.98\% and 99.97\%.}},

The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web.

    abstract = {{In this paper we study the classification of spatiotemporal pattern of one-dimensional cellular automata (CA) whereas the classification comprises CA rules including their initial conditions. We propose an exploratory analysis method based on the normalized compression distance (NCD) of spatiotemporal patterns which is used as dissimilarity measure for a hierarchical clustering. Our approach is different with respect to the following points. First, the classification of spatiotemporal pattern is comparative because the NCD evaluates explicitly the difference of compressibility among two objects, e.g., strings corresponding to spatiotemporal patterns. This is in contrast to all other measures applied so far in a similar context because they are essentially univariate. Second, Kolmogorov complexity, which underlies the NCD, was used in the classification of CA with respect to their spatiotemporal pattern. Third, our method is semiautomatic allowing us to investigate hundreds or thousands of CA rules or initial conditions simultaneously to gain insights into their organizational structure. Our numerical results are not only plausible confirming previous classification attempts but also shed light on the intricate influence of random initial conditions on the classification results.}},

@article{Stovicek2010General,
    abstract = {{The lifestyle of wild and laboratory yeast strains significantly differs. In contrast to the smooth colonies of laboratory strains, wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains form biofilm-like, strikingly structured colonies possessing distinctive traits enabling them to better survive in hostile environments in the wild. Here, comparing three sets of strains forming differently structured colonies (fluffy, semi-fluffy and smooth), each derived from ancestors with distinct genetic backgrounds isolated from natural settings (BR-88, BR-99 and BR-103), we specified the factors essential for the formation of structured colonies, i.e. for the lifestyle most likely to be preferred in the wild. The ability to form an abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) is one of the features typical for structured colonies. ECM influences colony architecture and many other physiological properties, such as the capability to retain water in a 2-fold surplus to wet cell biomass. ECM composition, however, differs among distinct strains, depending on their particular genetic background. We further show that the expression of certain genes (AQY1, FLO11) is also strictly related to the particular colony morphology, being highest in the most structured colonies. Flo11p adhesin, important for cell–cell and cell-surface adhesion, is essential for the formation of fluffy colonies and thus significantly contributes to the phenotype variability of wild yeast strains. On the other hand, surprisingly, neither the cell shape nor budding pattern nor the ability to form pseudohyphae directly influences the formation of three-dimensional fluffy colony architecture.}},

This paper presents a fully automated tracking method for quantitative cell cycle analysis. In the proposed tracking method, we introduce a neighboring graph to characterize the spatial distribution of neighboring nuclei, and a novel dissimilarity measure is designed based on the spatial distribution, nuclei morphological appearance, migration, and intensity information. Then, we employ the integer programming and division matching strategy, together with the novel dissimilarity measure, to track cell nuclei. We applied this new tracking method for the tracking of HeLa cancer cells over several cell cycles, and the validation results showed that the high accuracy for segmentation and tracking at 99.5\% and 90.0\%, respectively. The tracking method has been implemented in the cell-cycle analysis software package, DCELLIQ, which is freely available.}},

In time-lapse video microscopy, manual cell tracking remains the most common method of analyzing migratory behavior of cell populations. In addition to being labor-intensive, this method is susceptible to user-dependent errors regarding the selection of "representative" subsets of cells and manual determination of precise cell positions.RESULTS:We have quantitatively analyzed these error sources, demonstrating that manual cell tracking of pancreatic cancer cells lead to mis-calculation of migration rates of up to 410\%. In order to provide for objective measurements of cell migration rates, we have employed multi-target tracking technologies commonly used in radar applications to develop fully automated cell identification and tracking system suitable for high throughput screening of video sequences of unstained living cells.CONCLUSION:We demonstrate that our automatic multi target tracking system identifies cell objects, follows individual cells and computes migration rates with high precision, clearly outperforming manual procedures.}},

    abstract = {{Cellular decisions are determined by complex molecular interaction networks. Large-scale signaling networks are currently being reconstructed, but the kinetic parameters and quantitative data that would allow for dynamic modeling are still scarce. Therefore, computational studies based upon the structure of these networks are of great interest. Here, a methodology relying on a logical formalism is applied to the functional analysis of the complex signaling network governing the activation of T cells via the T cell receptor, the CD4/CD8 co-receptors, and the accessory signaling receptor CD28. Our large-scale Boolean model, which comprises 94 nodes and 123 interactions and is based upon well-established qualitative knowledge from primary T cells, reveals important structural features (e.g., feedback loops and network-wide dependencies) and recapitulates the global behavior of this network for an array of published data on T cell activation in wild-type and knock-out conditions. More importantly, the model predicted unexpected signaling events after antibody-mediated perturbation of CD28 and after genetic knockout of the kinase Fyn that were subsequently experimentally validated. Finally, we show that the logical model reveals key elements and potential failure modes in network functioning and provides candidates for missing links. In summary, our large-scale logical model for T cell activation proved to be a promising in silico tool, and it inspires immunologists to ask new questions. We think that it holds valuable potential in foreseeing the effects of drugs and network modifications.}},

@article{Maree2006Polarization,
    abstract = {{Eukariotic cell motility is a complex phenomenon, in which the cytoskeleton and its major constituent, actin, play an essential role. Actin forms polymers of long, stiff filaments that are cross-linked into an anisotropic network inside a thin sheet-like cellular protrusion, the lamellipod. At the leading edge of this structure, polymerization of actin filaments creates the force that pushes out the membrane and leads to translocation of a motile cell. Dynamics of the actin network account for changes in cell shape, crawling motion and turning of the cell in response to external cues. Regulating the dynamics of the cytoskeleton, and playing a central role in signal transduction in the cell, are Cdc42, Rac and Rho (GTPases of the rho family, collectively known as the small G-proteins) and the actin nucleating complex, Arp2/3. In this paper, we use a multiscale modelling approach in a 2D model of a motile cell. We describe the mutual interactions of the small G-proteins, and their effects on capping and side-branching of actin filaments. We incorporate the pushing exerted by oriented actin filament ends on the cell edge, and a Rho-dependent contraction force. Combining these biochemical and mechanical aspects, we investigate the dynamics of a model epidermal fish keratocyte through in silico experiments. Our model gives insight into how, in response to some cue, a cell can polarize, form a leading edge, and move; concomitantly it explains how a keratocyte cell can maintain its shape and polarity, even after removal of the initial stimulus, and how it can change direction quickly in response to changes in its environment. We show that establishment of polarity stems from interactions of Cdc42, Rac and Rho, while maintenance and robustness of polarity is due to the rapid cytosolic diffusion of the inactive (GDI-bound) forms of the small G-proteins. Our model produces a cell shape that closely resembles the keratocytes and correct speeds for biologically reasonable parameter values. Movies of the simulations can be obtained from http://theory.bio.uu.nl/stan/keratocyte.}},

    abstract = {{A system of rigid bodies with multiple simultaneous unilateral contacts is considered in this paper. The problem is to predict the velocities of the bodies and the frictional forces acting on the simultaneous multicontacts. This paper presents a numerical method based on an extension of an explicit time-stepping scheme and an application of the differential inclusion process introduced by J. J. Moreau. From a differential kinematic analysis of contacts, we derive a set of transfer equations in the velocity-based time-stepping formulation. In applying the Gauss-Seidel iterative scheme, the transfer equations are combined with the Signorini conditions and Coulomb's friction law. The contact forces are properly resolved in each iteration, without resorting to any linearization of the friction cone. The proposed numerical method is illustrated with examples, and its performance is compared with an acceleration-based scheme using linear complementary techniques. Multibody contact systems are broadly involved in many engineering applications. The motivation of this is to solve for the contact forces and body motion for planning the fixture-inserting operation. However, the results of the paper can be generally used in problems involving multibody contacts, such as robotic manipulation, mobile robots, computer graphics and simulation, etc. The paper presents a numerical method based on an extension of an explicit time-stepping scheme, and an application of the differential inclusion process introduced by J. J. Moreau, and compares the numerical results with an acceleration-based scheme with linear complementary techniques. We first describe the mathematical model of contact kinematics of smooth rigid bodies. Then, we present the Gauss-Seidel iterative method for resolving the multiple simultaneous contacts within the time-stepping framework. Finally, numerical examples are given and compared with the previous results of a different approach, which shows that the simulation results of these two methods agree well, and it is also generally more efficient, as it is an explicit method. This paper focuses on the description of the proposed time-stepping and Gauss-Seidel iterations and their numerical implementation, and several theoretical issues are yet to be resolved,-
 like the convergence and uniqueness of the Gauss-Seidel iteration, and the existence and uniqueness of a positive k in solving frictional forces. However, our limited numerical experience has indicated positive answers to these questions. We have always found a single positive root of k and a convergent solution in the Gauss-Seidel iteration for all of our examples.}},

Using mutants of Myo2p specifically impaired in peroxisome binding, we dissect cell cycle–dependent and peroxisome partitioning–dependent mechanisms of Inp2p regulation. We find that although total Inp2p levels oscillate with the cell cycle, Inp2p levels on individual peroxisomes are controlled by peroxisome inheritance, as Inp2p aberrantly accumulates and decorates all peroxisomes in mother cells when peroxisome partitioning is abolished. We also find that Inp2p is a phosphoprotein whose level of phosphorylation is coupled to the cell cycle irrespective of peroxisome positioning in the cell. Our findings demonstrate that both organelle positioning and cell cycle progression control the levels of organelle-specific receptors for molecular motors to ultimately achieve an equidistribution of compartments between mother and daughter cells.}},

An inherent problem for most cell tracking algorithms is over- or under-segmentation of cells - many algorithms tend to recognize one cell as several cells or vice versa.RESULTS:We propose to approach this problem through so-called topological alignments, which we apply to address the problem of linking segmentations of two consecutive frames in the video sequence. Starting from the output of a conventional segmentation procedure, we align pairs of consecutive frames through assigning sets of segments in one frame to sets of segments in the next frame. We achieve this through finding maximum weighted solutions to a generalized "bipartite matching" between two hierarchies of segments, where we derive weights from relative overlap scores of convex hulls of sets of segments. For solving the matching task, we rely on an integer linear program.CONCLUSION:Practical experiments demonstrate that the matching task can be solved efficiently in practice, and that our method is both effective and useful for tracking cells in data sets derived from a so-called Large Scale Digital Cell Analysis System (LSDCAS).AVAILABILITY:The source code of the implementation is available for download from http://www.picb.ac.cn/patterns/Software/topaln.}},

Peroxisomes are ubiquitous, endoplasmic reticulum–derived organelles that perform requisite biochemical functions intimately connected to lipid metabolism. Upon cell division, cells have to strictly control peroxisome division and inheritance to maintain an appropriate number of peroxisomes in each cell. Peroxisome division follows a specific sequence of events that include peroxisome elongation, membrane constriction, and peroxisome fission. Pex11 proteins mediate the elongation step of peroxisome division, whereas dynamin-related proteins execute the final fission. The mechanisms responsible for peroxisome membrane constriction are poorly understood. Molecular players involved in peroxisome inheritance are just beginning to be elucidated. Inp1p and Inp2p are two recently identified peroxisomal proteins that perform antagonistic functions in regulating peroxisome inheritance in budding yeast. Inp1p promotes the retention of peroxisomes in mother cells and buds by attaching peroxisomes to as-yet-unidentified cortical structures.

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.}},

@article{Yang2010Role,
    abstract = {{The central nervous system (CNS) historically has been considered an immune-privileged organ, lacking a lymphatic system and shielded from the circulatory system by the blood-brain barrier. Microglia are an abundant portion of the CNS cell population, comprising 5\% to 20\% of the total glial cell population, and are as numerous as neurons. A crucial function of microglia is the ability to generate significant innate and adaptive immune responses. Microglia are involved in first line innate immunity of the CNS. Proper antigen presentation is critical in the generation of specific, durable responses by the adaptive immune system, and requires interaction between the T cell receptor and processed antigen peptide presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules by the antigen presenting cells (APC). Microglia also have a large regulatory role in CNS immunity. Histopathologic studies of glioma tissue have consistently shown high levels of infiltrating microglia. Microglia are also localized diffusely throughout the tumor, rather than to the areas of necrosis, and phagocytosis of glioma cells or debris by microglia is not observed. Recent evidence indicates that glioma-infiltrating microglia/macrophages might be promoting tumor growth by facilitating immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironment. When activated, microglia can be potent immune effector cells, able to perform a broad range of functions, and they mediate both innate and adaptive responses during CNS injury and disease while remaining quiescent in the steady state. Their versatility in bridging the gap between the immune-privileged CNS and the peripheral immune system, in addition to their significant numbers in gliomas, makes them an attractive candidate in immunotherapy for gliomas. An enhanced understanding of microglia–glioma interaction may provide better methods to manipulate the glioma microenvironment to allow the generation of a specific and durable anti-glioma immunity. The role of microglia in CNS immunity is reviewed, with a focus on key advances made in glioma immunology.}},

However, important concepts such as TAM heterogeneity and the nature of the monocytic TAM precursors remain speculative. Here, we show for the first time that mouse mammary tumors contained functionally distinct subsets of TAMs and provide markers for their identification. Furthermore, in search of the TAM progenitors, we show that the tumor-monocyte pool almost exclusively consisted of Ly6ChiCX3CR1low monocytes, which continuously seeded tumors and renewed all nonproliferating TAM subsets. Interestingly, gene and protein profiling indicated that distinct TAM populations differed at the molecular level and could be classified based on the classic (M1) versus alternative (M2) macrophage activation paradigm. Importantly, the more M2-like TAMs were enriched in hypoxic tumor areas, had a superior proangiogenic activity in vivo, and increased in numbers as tumors progressed. Finally, it was shown that the TAM subsets were poor antigen presenters, but could suppress T-cell activation, albeit by using different suppressive mechanisms. Together, our data help to unravel the complexities of the tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell compartment and provide a rationale for targeting specialized TAM subsets, thereby optimally  ” re-educating” the TAM compartment.

    abstract = {{Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a family of cytokines for which the dysregulation of expression is involved in many diseases; for some, excess VEGF causes pathological hypervascularization, while for others VEGF-induced vascular remodeling may alleviate ischemia and/or hypoxia. Anti-angiogenic therapies attacking the VEGF pathway have begun to live up to their promise for treatment of certain cancers and of age-related macular degeneration. However, the corollary is not yet true: in coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease, clinical trials of pro-angiogenic VEGF delivery have not, so far, proven successful. The VEGF and VEGF-receptor system is complex, with at least five ligand genes, some encoding multiple protein isoforms and five receptor genes. A systems biology approach for designing pro-angiogenic therapies, using a combination of quantitative experimental approaches and detailed computational models, is essential to deal with this complexity and to understand the effects of drugs targeting the system. This approach allows us to learn from unsuccessful clinical trials and to design and test novel single therapeutics or combinations of therapeutics. Among the parameters that can be varied in order to determine optimal strategy are dosage, timing of multiple doses, route of administration, and the molecular target.

To get insights on the molecular networks regulating microglia activation, we analyzed expression, regulation and functional relevance of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFR) 2 in cultured mouse microglia. We found that microglia upregulate TNFR2 mRNA and protein and shed large amounts of soluble TNFR2, but not TNFR1, in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli and through activation of TNFR2 itself. By microarray analysis, we demonstrate that TNFR2 stimulation in microglia regulates expression of genes involved in immune processes, including molecules with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective function like granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, adrenomedullin and IL-10. In addition, we identify IFN-γ as a regulator of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective factors induced by TNFR2 stimulation. These data indicate that, through TNFR2, microglia may contribute to the counter-regulatory response activated in neuropathological conditions.}},

In addition to the basic assumptions of volume conservation, random cell motion, and cell–cell and cell–ECM adhesion, and a non-standard assumption that cytoskeletal polymerization generates an internal pressure tending to keep cells convex, we find that we need only two conditions for convergent extension. (1) Each cell type has a particular aspect ratio towards which it regulates its geometry. We do not require that cells align in a specific orientation, e.g. to be oriented mediolaterally. (2) The elongating tissue is composed of cells that prefer to be elongated, and these cells must be accompanied by cells which prefer to be round. The latter effectively provide a boundary to capture. In simulations, our model tissue extends and converges to a stacked arrangement of elongated cells one cell wide, an arrangement which is seen in ascidian notochords, but which has not been observed in other models. This arrangement is achieved without any direct mediolateral bias other than that which is provided by the physical edge of the adjacent tissue.}},

@article{Keller2000Mechanisms,
    abstract = {{The cells of many embryonic tissues actively narrow in one dimension (convergence) and lengthen in the perpendicular dimension (extension). Convergence and extension are ubiquitous and important tissue movements in metazoan morphogenesis. In vertebrates, the dorsal axial and paraxial mesodermal tissues, the notochordal and somitic mesoderm, converge and extend. In amphibians as well as a number of other organisms where these movements appear, they occur by mediolateral cell intercalation, the rearrangement of cells along the mediolateral axis to produce an array that is narrower in this axis and longer in the anteroposterior axis. In amphibians, mesodermal cell intercalation is driven by bipolar, mediolaterally directed protrusive activity, which appears to exert traction on adjacent cells and pulls the cells between one another. In addition, the notochordal-somitic boundary functions in convergence and extension by 'capturing' notochordal cells as they contact the boundary, thus elongating the boundary. The prospective neural tissue also actively converges and extends parallel with the mesoderm. In contrast to the mesoderm, cell intercalation in the neural plate normally occurs by monopolar protrusive activity directed medially, towards the midline notoplate-floor-plate region. In contrast, the notoplate-floor-plate region appears to converge and extend by adhering to and being towed by or perhaps migrating on the underlying notochord. Converging and extending mesoderm stiffens by a factor of three or four and exerts up to 0.6 microN force. Therefore, active, force-producing convergent extension, the mechanism of cell intercalation, requires a mechanism to actively pull cells between one another while maintaining a tissue stiffness sufficient to push with a substantial force. Based on the evidence thus far, a cell-cell traction model of intercalation is described. The essential elements of such a morphogenic machine appear to be (i) bipolar, mediolaterally orientated or monopolar, medially directed protrusive activity; (ii) this protrusive activity results in mediolaterally orientated or medially directed traction of cells on one another; (iii) tractive protrusions are confined to the ends of the cells; (iv) a mechanically stable cell cortex over the bulk of the cell body which serves as a movable substratum for the orientated or directed cell traction. The implications of this model for cell adhesion, regulation of cell motility and cell polarity, and cell and tissue biomechanics are discussed.}},

    abstract = {{Transendothelial migration is a crucial process of the metastatic cascade in which a malignant cell attaches itself to the endothelial layer forming the inner wall of a blood or lymph vessel and creates a gap through which it enters into the bloodstream (or lymphatic system) and then is transported to distant parts of the body. In this process both biological pathways involving cell adhesion molecules such as VE-cadherin and N-cadherin, and the biophysical properties of the cells play an important role. In this paper, we present one of the first mathematical models considering the problem of cancer cell intravasation. We use an individual force-based multi-scale approach which accounts for intra- and inter-cellular protein pathways and for the physical properties of the cells, and a modelling framework which accounts for the biological shape of the vessel. Using our model, we study the influence of different protein pathways in the achievement of transendothelial migration and give quantitative simulation results comparable with real experiments.}},

It has also been suggested that evolution may tend to adjust the parameters of the genetic network so that it operates close to a critical state, which should provide evolutionary advantage ; this hypothesis has received intriguing, although not definitive support from recent findings. It is therefore particularly interesting to consider how the tissue-like organization alters the dynamical behavior of the networks close to a critical state.

Here we present a tracking algorithm that addresses the principal challenges of SPT, namely high particle density, particle motion heterogeneity, temporary particle disappearance, and particle merging and splitting. The algorithm first links particles between consecutive frames and then links the resulting track segments into complete trajectories. Both steps are formulated as global combinatorial optimization problems whose solution identifies the overall most likely set of particle trajectories throughout a movie. Using this approach, we show that the GTPase dynamin differentially affects the kinetics of long- and short-lived endocytic structures and that the motion of CD36 receptors along cytoskeleton-mediated linear tracks increases their aggregation probability. Both applications indicate the requirement for robust and complete tracking of dense particle fields to dissect the mechanisms of receptor organization at the level of the plasma membrane.}},

@article{Chen2006Feedback,
    abstract = {{Many fungi undergo a developmental transition from a unicellular yeast form to an invasive filamentous form in response to environmental cues. Here we describe a quorum signaling pathway that links environmental sensing to morphogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Saccharomyces cells secrete aromatic alcohols that stimulate morphogenesis by inducing the expression of FLO11 through a Tpk2p-dependent mechanism. Mutants defective in synthesis of these alcohols show reduced filamentous growth, which is partially suppressed by the addition of these aromatic alcohols. The production of these auto signaling alcohols is regulated by nitrogen: High ammonia restricts it by repressing the expression of their biosynthetic pathway, whereas nitrogen-poor conditions activate it. Moreover, the production of these aromatic alcohols is controlled by cell density and subjected to positive feedback regulation, which requires the transcription factor Aro80p. These interactions define a quorum-sensing circuit that allows Saccharomyces to respond to both cell density and the nutritional state of the environment. These same autoregulatory molecules do not evoke the morphological switch in Candida albicans, suggesting that these molecular signals are species-specific.}},

@article{Granek2010Environmental,
    abstract = {{Nutrient stresses trigger a variety of developmental switches in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One of the least understood of such responses is the development of complex colony morphology, characterized by intricate, organized, and strain-specific patterns of colony growth and architecture. The genetic bases of this phenotype and the key environmental signals involved in its induction have heretofore remained poorly understood. By surveying multiple strain backgrounds and a large number of growth conditions, we show that limitation for fermentable carbon sources coupled with a rich nitrogen source is the primary trigger for the colony morphology response in budding yeast. Using knockout mutants and transposon-mediated mutagenesis, we demonstrate that two key signaling networks regulating this response are the filamentous growth MAP kinase cascade and the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway. We further show synergistic epistasis between Rim15, a kinase involved in integration of nutrient signals, and other genes in these pathways. Ploidy, mating-type, and genotype-by-environment interactions also appear to play a role in the controlling colony morphology. Our study highlights the high degree of network reuse in this model eukaryote; yeast use the same core signaling pathways in multiple contexts to integrate information about environmental and physiological states and generate diverse developmental outputs. Baker's yeast forms smooth round colonies when grown in favorable conditions. When starved for one or more nutrients, yeast can alter its growth pattern to produce complex structures consisting of numerous interacting cells. One mode of growth, the colony morphology response, produces visually striking, lacy colony architectures. We describe both conditions that induce this morphology and also genes and pathways that are required for the response. We demonstrate that low levels of carbon combined with abundant nitrogen trigger complex colony formation. Using a candidate gene approach coupled with genome-wide mutagenesis, we identified genes involved in the production of complex colony morphology. Many of these genes are components of either a MAP kinase cascade or the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway, two well-studied signaling pathways that are conserved across eukaryotic organisms. Yeast use these pathways to mediate cellular responses to changes in their environment. We observe shared characteristics between complex colonies and biofilms, which are organized communities of microorganisms with relevance to human health and human infrastructure, making colony morphology a candidate model for understanding how microorganisms interact to form complex structures.}},

These results reveal the logic of cellular metabolism during different phases of the life of a yeast cell.

Such oscillations in metabolic state might occur during the course of other biological cycles.}},

    abstract = {{In mitosis, the kinetochores of chromosomes that lack full
microtubule attachments and/or mechanical tension activate
a signaling pathway called the mitotic spindle checkpoint that
blocks progression into anaphase and prevents premature
segregation of the chromatids until chromosomes become
aligned at the metaphase plate. The spindle checkpoint is
responsible for arresting cells in mitosis in response to
chemotherapeutic spindle poisons such as paclitaxel or
vinblastine. Some cancer cells show a weakened checkpoint
signaling system that may contribute to chromosome instability
in tumors. Because complete absence of the spindle
checkpoint leads to catastrophic cell division, we reasoned
that drugs targeting the checkpoint might provide a therapeutic
window in which the checkpoint would be eliminated
in cancer cells but sufficiently preserved in normal cells.
We developed an assay to identify lead compounds that inhibit
the spindle checkpoint. Most cells respond to microtubule
drugs by activating the spindle checkpoint and arresting
in mitosis with a rounded morphology. Our assay depended
on the ability of checkpoint inhibitor compounds to drive
mitotic exit and cause cells to flatten onto the substrate in
the continuous presence of microtubule drugs. In this
study, we characterize one of the compounds, OM137, as an
inhibitor of Aurora kinases. We find that this compound is
growth inhibitory to cultured cells when applied at high

This segmentation step is a prerequisite for an accurate quantitative analysis of cell morphodynamics during embryogenesis and it is the basis for an integrated understanding of biological processes. The segmentation of embryonic cells requires live zebrafish embryos fluorescently labeled to highlight sub-cellular structures and designing specific algorithms by adapting classical methods to image features. Our strategy includes the following steps: the signal-to-noise ratio is first improved by an edge-preserving filtering, then the cell shape is reconstructed applying a fully automated algorithm based on a generalized version of the Subjective Surfaces technique. Finally we present a procedure for the algorithm validation either from the accuracy and the robustness perspective.}},

                Although classical genetic and biochemical approaches have identified hundreds of proteins that function in the dynamic remodeling of cell shape in response to upstream signals, there is currently little systems-level understanding of the organization and composition of signaling networks that regulate cell morphology. We have developed quantitative morphological profiling methods to systematically investigate the role of individual genes in the regulation of cell morphology in a fast, robust, and cost-efficient manner. We analyzed a compendium of quantitative morphological signatures and described the existence of local signaling networks that act to regulate cell protrusion, adhesion, and tension.

Cell-based models then predict the tissue-level patterns the cells produce collectively. The first step in a cell-based modeling approach is to isolate sub-processes, e.g. the patterning capabilities of one or a few cell types in cell cultures. Cell-based models can then identify the mechanisms responsible for patterning in vitro. This review discusses two cell culture models of morphogenesis that have been studied using this combined experimental-mathematical approach: chondrogenesis (cartilage patterning) and vasculogenesis (de novo blood vessel growth). In both these systems, radically different models can equally plausibly explain the in vitro patterns. Quantitative descriptions of cell behavior would help choose between alternative models. We will briefly review the experimental methodology (microfluidics technology and traction force microscopy) used to measure responses of individual cells to their micro-environment, including chemical gradients, physical forces and neighboring cells. We conclude by discussing how to include quantitative cell descriptions into a cell-based model: the Cellular Potts model.}},

Secondly, we present our own novel method for tracking cell boundaries of moving cells, the Electrostatic Contour Migration Method (ECMM), as an alternative to the generally accepted level set method (LSM). ECMM smoothly tracks regions of the cell boundary over time to compute local membrane displacements using the simple underlying concept of electrostatics.

    abstract = {{Advances in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy have enabled us to directly observe dynamic cellular phenomena. Although the techniques themselves have promoted the understanding of dynamic cellular functions, the vast number of images acquired has generated a need for automated processing tools to extract statistical information. A problem underlying the analysis of time-lapse cell images is the lack of rigorous methods to extract morphodynamic properties. Here, we propose an algorithm called edge evolution tracking (EET) to quantify the relationship between local morphological changes and local fluorescence intensities around a cell edge using time-lapse microscopy images. This algorithm enables us to trace the local edge extension and contraction by defining subdivided edges and their corresponding positions in successive frames. Thus, this algorithm enables the investigation of cross-correlations between local morphological changes and local intensity of fluorescent signals by considering the time shifts. By applying EET to fluorescence resonance energy transfer images of the Rho-family GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, we examined the cross-correlation between the local area difference and GTPase activity. The calculated correlations changed with time-shifts as expected, but surprisingly, the peak of the correlation coefficients appeared with a 6\^{a}€ ” 8 min time shift of morphological changes and preceded the Rac1 or Cdc42 activities. Our method enables the quantification of the dynamics of local morphological change and local protein activity and statistical investigation of the relationship between them by considering time shifts in the relationship. Thus, this algorithm extends the value of time-lapse imaging data to better understand dynamics of cellular function.}},

The process involves the collection of sufficient and diverse high-quality data, translation of these data into spatial restraints, and an optimization that uses the restraints to generate an ensemble of structures consistent with the data. Analysis of the ensemble produces a detailed architectural map of the assembly. We developed our approach on a challenging model system, the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC acts as a dynamic barrier, controlling access to and from the nucleus, and in yeast is a 50 MDa assembly of 456 proteins. The resulting structure, presented in an accompanying paper, reveals the configuration of the proteins in the NPC, providing insights into its evolution and architectural principles. The present approach should be applicable to many other macromolecular assemblies.}},

In recent years, interest in automatic leukocyte classification using image analysis has increased rapidly. Such systems collect a series of images in which each cell must be segmented accurately to be classified correctly. Although segmentation algorithms have been developed for sparse cells in peripheral blood, the problem of segmenting the complex cell clusters characterizing bone marrow images is harder and has not been addressed previously.We present a novel algorithm for segmenting clusters of any number of densely packed cells. The algorithm first oversegments the image into cell subparts. These parts are then assembled into complete cells by solving a combinatorial optimization problem in an efficient way.Our experimental results show that the algorithm succeeds in correctly segmenting densely clustered leukocytes in bone marrow images.The presented algorithm enables image analysis-based analysis of bone marrow samples for the first time and may also be adopted for other digital cytometric applications where separation of complex cell clusters is required. {\copyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

How yeast cells within such populations cooperate and how their dimorphic switch to filamentous growth is regulated are therefore important questions. Studying population development, we discovered that Saccharomyces cerevisiae microcolonies early after their origination from one cell successfully occupy the territory via dimorphic transition, which is induced by ammonia and other volatile amines independently on cell ploidy and nutrients. It results in oriented pseudohyphal cell expansion in the direction of ammonia source, which consequently leads to unification of adjacent microcolonies to one more numerous entity. The further population development is accompanied by another dimorphic switch, which is strictly dependent on Flo11p adhesin and is indispensable for proper formation of biofilm-like aerial 3-D colony architecture. In this, Flo11p is required for both elongation of cells organized to radial clusters (formed earlier within the colony) and their subsequent pseudohyphal expansion. Just before this expansion, Flo11p relocalizes from the bud-neck of radial cell clusters also to the tip of elongated cells.}},

@article{Balleza2008Critical,
    abstract = {{The coordinated expression of the different genes in an organism is essential to sustain functionality under the random external perturbations to which the organism might be subjected. To cope with such external variability, the global dynamics of the genetic network must possess two central properties. (a) It must be robust enough as to guarantee stability under a broad range of external conditions, and (b) it must be flexible enough to recognize and integrate specific external signals that may help the organism to change and adapt to different environments. This compromise between robustness and adaptability has been observed in dynamical systems operating at the brink of a phase transition between order and chaos. Such systems are termed critical. Thus, criticality, a precise, measurable, and well characterized property of dynamical systems, makes it possible for robustness and adaptability to coexist in living organisms. In this work we investigate the dynamical properties of the gene transcription networks reported for S. cerevisiae, E. coli, and B. subtilis, as well as the network of segment polarity genes of D. melanogaster, and the network of flower development of A. thaliana. We use hundreds of microarray experiments to infer the nature of the regulatory interactions among genes, and implement these data into the Boolean models of the genetic networks. Our results show that, to the best of the current experimental data available, the five networks under study indeed operate close to criticality. The generality of this result suggests that criticality at the genetic level might constitute a fundamental evolutionary mechanism that generates the great diversity of dynamically robust living forms that we observe around us.}},

During angiogenesis, cellular processes are tightly coordinated by signaling molecules and their receptors. Understanding how endothelial cells synthesize multiple biochemical signals can catalyze the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat cancer. This study is the first to propose a signal transduction model highlighting the cross-talk between key receptors involved in angiogenesis, namely the VEGF, integrin, and cadherin receptors. From experimental data, we construct a network model of receptor cross-talk and analyze its dynamics. We identify relationships between receptor activation combinations and cellular function, and show that cross-talk is crucial to phenotype determination. The network converges to a unique set of output states that correspond to known cell phenotypes: migratory, proliferating, quiescent, apoptotic, and it predicts one phenotype that challenges the  ” go or grow” hypothesis. Finally, we use the model to study protein inhibition and to suggest molecular targets for anti-angiogenic therapies.}},

@article{Chang2008Transcriptomewide,
    abstract = {{
                Phenotypic cell-to-cell variability within clonal populations may be a manifestation of 'gene expression noise', or it may reflect stable phenotypic variants. Such 'non-genetic cell individuality' can arise from the slow fluctuations of protein levels in mammalian cells. These fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering a clonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whether this heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fate decisions in stem cells. Here we show that in clonal populations of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous 'outlier' cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture model that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a >200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the erythroid-prone cells, or a >15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref. 11) expression among myeloid-prone cells. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision.

@article{Wittmann2009Transforming,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The understanding of regulatory and signaling networks has long been a core objective in Systems Biology. Knowledge about these networks is mainly of qualitative nature, which allows the construction of Boolean models, where the state of a component is either 'off' or 'on'. While often able to capture the essential behavior of a network, these models can never reproduce detailed time courses of concentration levels.Nowadays however, experiments yield more and more quantitative data. An obvious question therefore is how qualitative models can be used to explain and predict the outcome of these experiments.RESULTS:In this contribution we present a canonical way of transforming Boolean into continuous models, where the use of multivariate polynomial interpolation allows transformation of logic operations into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE). The method is standardized and can readily be applied to large networks. Other, more limited approaches to this task are briefly reviewed and compared. Moreover, we discuss and generalize existing theoretical results on the relation between Boolean and continuous models. As a test case a logical model is transformed into an extensive continuous ODE model describing the activation of T-cells. We discuss how parameters for this model can be determined such that quantitative experimental results are explained and predicted, including time-courses for multiple ligand concentrations and binding affinities of different ligands. This shows that from the continuous model we may obtain biological insights not evident from the discrete one.CONCLUSION:The presented approach will facilitate the interaction between modeling and experiments. Moreover, it provides a straightforward way to apply quantitative analysis methods to qualitatively described systems.}},

@article{Pal2005Generating,
    abstract = {{Motivation: Dynamical modeling of gene regulation via network models constitutes a key problem for genomics. The long-run characteristics of a dynamical system are critical and their determination is a primary aspect of system analysis. In the other direction, system synthesis involves constructing a network possessing a given set of properties. This constitutes the inverse problem. Generally, the inverse problem is ill-posed, meaning there will be many networks, or perhaps none, possessing the desired properties. Relative to long-run behavior, we may wish to construct networks possessing a desirable steady-state distribution. This paper addresses the long-run inverse problem pertaining to Boolean networks (BNs).  Results: The long-run behavior of a BN is characterized by its attractors. The rest of the state transition diagram is partitioned into level sets, the j-th level set being composed of all states that transition to one of the attractor states in exactly j transitions. We present two algorithms for the attractor inverse problem. The attractors are specified, and the sizes of the predictor sets and the number of levels are constrained. Algorithm complexity and performance are analyzed. The algorithmic solutions have immediate application. Under the assumption that sampling is from the steady state, a basic criterion for checking the validity of a designed network is that there should be concordance between the attractor states of the model and the data states. This criterion can be used to test a design algorithm: randomly select a set of states to be used as data states; generate a BN possessing the selected states as attractors, perhaps with some added requirements such as constraints on the number of predictors and the level structure; apply the design algorithm; and check the concordance between the attractor states of the designed network and the data states.

@article{Huang2000ShapeDependent,
    abstract = {{Development of characteristic tissue patterns requires that individual cells be switched locally between different phenotypes or  ” fates;” while one cell may proliferate, its neighbors may differentiate or die. Recent studies have revealed that local switching between these different gene programs is controlled through interplay between soluble growth factors, insoluble extracellular matrix molecules, and mechanical forces which produce cell shape distortion. Although the precise molecular basis remains unknown, shape-dependent control of cell growth and function appears to be mediated by tension-dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton. However, the question remains: how can a generalized physical stimulus, such as cell distortion, activate the same set of genes and signaling proteins that are triggered by molecules which bind to specific cell surface receptors. In this article, we use computer simulations based on dynamic Boolean networks to show that the different cell fates that a particular cell can exhibit may represent a preprogrammed set of common end programs or  ” attractors” which self-organize within the cell's regulatory networks. In this type of dynamic network model of information processing, generalized stimuli (e.g., mechanical forces) and specific molecular cues elicit signals which follow different trajectories, but eventually converge onto one of a small set of common end programs (growth, quiescence, differentiation, apoptosis, etc.). In other words, if cells use this type of information processing system, then control of cell function would involve selection of preexisting (latent) behavioral modes of the cell, rather than instruction by specific binding molecules. Importantly, the results of the computer simulation closely mimic experimental data obtained with living endothelial cells. The major implication of this finding is that current methods used for analysis of cell function that rely on characterization of linear signaling pathways or clusters of genes with common activity profiles may overlook the most critical features of cellular information processing which normally determine how signal specificity is established and maintained in living cells. }},

    abstract = {{Motivation: A major objective of gene regulatory network modeling, in addition to gaining a deeper understanding of genetic regulation and control, is the development of computational tools for the identification and discovery of potential targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as cancer. We consider the general question of the potential effect of individual genes on the global dynamical network behavior, both from the view of random gene perturbation as well as intervention in order to elicit desired network behavior.Results: Using a recently introduced class of models, called Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBNs), this paper develops a model for random gene perturbations and derives an explicit formula for the transition probabilities in the new PBN model. This result provides a building block for performing simulations and deriving other results concerning network dynamics. An example is provided to show how the gene perturbation model can be used to compute long-term influences of genes on other genes. Following this, the problem of intervention is addressed via the development of several computational tools based on first-passage times in Markov chains. The consequence is a methodology for finding the best gene with which to intervene in order to most likely achieve desirable network behavior. The ideas are illustrated with several examples in which the goal is to induce the network to transition into a desired state, or set of states. The corresponding issue of avoiding undesirable states is also addressed. Finally, the paper turns to the important problem of assessing the effect of gene perturbations on long-run network behavior. A bound on the steady-state probabilities is derived in terms of the perturbation probability. The result demonstrates that states of the network that are more 'easily reachable' from other states are more stable in the presence of gene perturbations. Consequently, these are hypothesized to correspond to cellular functional states.Availability: A library of functions written in MATLAB for simulating PBNs, constructing state-transition matrices, computing steady-state distributions, computing influences, modeling random gene perturbations, and finding optimal intervention targets, as described in this paper, is available on request from is@ieee.org.Contact: is@ieee.org}},

development based on the effect of surface tension of cells at the boundaries. We study
the process of interaction of mesodermal cells at the boundaries due to adhesion and
cortical tension, resulting in cellular intercalation. From in vivo experiments, we obtain
cell outlines of time-lapse images of cell movements during zebrafish embryo
development. Using Cellular Potts Model, we calculate the total surface energy of the
system of cells at different time intervals at cell contacts. We analyze the variations of
total energy depending on nature of cell contacts. We demonstrate that our model can be
viable by calculating the total surface energy value for experimentally observed
configurations of cells and showing that in our model these configurations correspond to
a decrease in total energy values in both two and three dimensions.}},

Synchronous Boolean networks are aclass of deterministic finite state machines which are used for the modeling ofgene regulatory networks. Their state transition graph cycles, calledattractors, represent cell types of the organism being modeled. When the effectof a disease or a mutation on an organism is studied, attractors have to bere-computed every time a fault is injected in the model. We present analgorithm for finding attractors which uses a SAT-based bounded model checking.Novel features of the algorithm compared to the traditional SAT-based boundedmodel checking approaches are: (1) a termination condition which does notrequire an explicit computation of the diameter and (2) a technique to reducethe number of additional clauses which are needed to make paths loop-free. Thepresented algorithm uses much less space than existing BDD-based approaches andhas a potential to handle several orders of magnitude larger networks.}},

The libraries currently contain 104,000 vectors, targeting each of 22,000 human and mouse genes with multiple sequence-verified constructs. To test the utility of the library for arrayed screens, we developed a screen based on high-content imaging to identify genes required for mitotic progression in human cancer cells and applied it to an arrayed set of 5,000 unique shRNA-expressing lentiviruses that target 1,028 human genes. The screen identified several known and 100 candidate regulators of mitotic progression and proliferation; the availability of multiple shRNAs targeting the same gene facilitated functional validation of putative hits. This work provides a widely applicable resource for loss-of-function screens, as well as a roadmap for its application to biological discovery.}},

Control measures include central or thymic tolerance, and peripheral tolerance mechanisms acting after naive T cells have encountered their cognate antigen, such as anergy induction, the contraction phase (whereby the majority of the expanded effector population undergoes apoptosis), and the action of regulatory T (Treg) cells. However, bystander T-cell activation circumvents the requirement for specific T-cell receptor stimulation, enabling T cells to bypass certain control checkpoints. The physiological relevance of the phenomenon is the subject of much controversy. This article argues that although of little consequence in the healthy individual, bystander activation could have a devastating impact in the context of disease.

Clearly, these are extremely ambitious aims, but recent developments in different life science disciplines slowly allow us to set them as realistic, although very distant, goals. Besides classical approaches to obtain high-resolution information of the molecules, particles and machines involved, we require approaches that can monitor collective behaviour of many molecules, particles and machines simultaneously, in order to reveal design principles of the systems as a whole. Here we will discuss approaches that fall in the latter category, namely time-lapse imaging and single-particle tracking (SPT) combined with computational analysis and modelling, and genome-wide RNA interference approaches to reveal the host components required for virus entry. These techniques should in the future allow us to assign host genes to the systems' functions and characteristics, and allow emergence-driven, in silico assembly of networks that include interactions with increasing hierarchy (molecules2013multiprotein complexes2013vesicles and organelles), and kinetics and subcellular spatiality, in order to allow realistic simulations of virus entry in real time.}},

@article{Jones2009Scoring,

Now, automated image analysis can effectively score many phenotypes. In practical application, customizing an image-analysis algorithm or finding a sufficient number of example cells to train a machine learning algorithm can be infeasible, particularly when positive control samples are not available and the phenotype of interest is rare. Here we present a supervised machine learning approach that uses iterative feedback to readily score multiple subtle and complex morphological phenotypes in high-throughput, image-based screens. First, automated cytological profiling extracts hundreds of numerical descriptors for every cell in every image. Next, the researcher generates a rule (i.e., classifier) to recognize cells with a phenotype of interest during a short, interactive training session using iterative feedback. Finally, all of the cells in the experiment are automatically classified and each sample is scored based on the presence of cells displaying the phenotype. By using this approach, we successfully scored images in RNA interference screens in 2 organisms for the prevalence of 15 diverse cellular morphologies, some of which were previously intractable.}},

RTS,S/AS02A is a pre-erythrocytic vaccine candidate based on Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite surface antigen. We aimed to assess vaccine efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety in young African children. Methods We did a double-blind, phase IIb, randomised controlled trial in Mozambique in 2022 children aged 1–4 years. The study included two cohorts of children living in two separate areas which underwent different follow-up schemes. Participants were randomly allocated three doses of either RTS,S/AS02A candidate malaria vaccine or control vaccines. The primary endpoint, determined in cohort 1 (n=1605), was time to first clinical episode of P falciparum malaria (axillary temperature ≥37·5°C and P falciparum asexual parasitaemia >2500 per μL) over a 6-month surveillance period. Efficacy for prevention of new infections was determined in cohort 2 (n=417). Analysis was per protocol. Findings 115 children in cohort 1 and 50 in cohort 2 did not receive all three doses and were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. Vaccine efficacy for the first clinical episodes was 29·9\% (95\% CI 11·0–44·8; p=0·004). At the end of the 6-month observation period, prevalence of P falciparum infection was 37\% lower in the RTS,S/AS02A group compared with the control group (11·9\% vs 18·9\%; p=0·0003). Vaccine efficacy for severe malaria was 57·7\% (95\% CI 16·2–80·6; p=0·019). In cohort 2, vaccine efficacy for extending time to first infection was 45·0\% (31·4–55·9; p<0·0001). Interpretation The RTS,S/AS02A vaccine was safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic. Our results show development of an effective vaccine against malaria is feasible. }},

Here we provide an empirical approach to estimating the number of clinical events caused by Plasmodium falciparum worldwide, by using a combination of epidemiological, geographical and demographic data. We estimate that there were 515 (range 300–660) million episodes of clinical P. falciparum malaria in 2002. These global estimates are up to 50\% higher than those reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and 200\% higher for areas outside Africa, reflecting the WHO's reliance upon passive national reporting for these countries.

@book{Bishop2006Pattern,
    abstract = {{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

@inproceedings{Hope2009Machinelearning,
    abstract = {{Development of in-vivo imaging methods often depends upon a correlative step involving analysis of tissue sections.This is especially true when molecular imaging approaches are involved. Preclinical and clinical drug trials often also have a similar dependence on histological correlation. However, obtaining accurate, quantitative, and potentially multiplexed analysis of tissue sections remains a challenge. CRI has developed multispectral hardware and powerful machine-learning imaging software to create an automated microscopy platform that can perform the necessay steps without need for hands-on expertise. A Nuance™ multispectral imaging system was integrated with an automated microscope platform including a 200-slide robotic slide handler to create an intelligent slide imaging system (Vectra™). The multispectral capability permits quantitative detection of multiple molecular signals in either brightfield or fluorescence mode. The system also includes a powerful automated image segmentation software (inForm™) that uses  ” learn-by-example” methods to create multi-class classifiers. While the feature selection and neural-net-based learning procedure are sophisticated and effective, the technical components are hidden from the user. Errors in classification can be readily corrected by amending the training regions and then repeating the training. Typically, only a few rounds of this are required. Depending on the set of images used for training, the entire training process can take a few seconds to a few minutes to complete. The resulting classifiers can used to differentiate relevant tissue regions (e.g., malignant and normal epithelia, stroma, necrosis, etc.) and to segment cellular compartments (nuclei, cytoplasm, and membrane) to allow for detailed, spatially resolved cell-by-cell multiparameter quantitation. The accuracy (vs. manual visual examination by expert pathologists) and practicality of the system has been demonstrated across hundreds of human clinical breast cancer specimens. Its generalizable software can be used for many different tasks as well, since it is easy for non-technical users to train on specimens of their choice. Once the classifiers and downstream quantitative analytical methods are created and validated, having such tools in place will be particularly valuable to developers of in-vivo imaging methodologies, since the histological correlates of in-vivo images can be evaluated automatically, and without ongoing recourse to potentially scarce pathologist input.}},

We here report that the induction of an EMT in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLEs) results in the acquisition of mesenchymal traits and in the expression of stem-cell markers. Furthermore, we show that those cells have an increased ability to form mammospheres, a property associated with mammary epithelial stem cells. Independent of this, stem cell-like cells isolated from HMLE cultures form mammospheres and express markers similar to those of HMLEs that have undergone an EMT. Moreover, stem-like cells isolated either from mouse or human mammary glands or mammary carcinomas express EMT markers. Finally, transformed human mammary epithelial cells that have undergone an EMT form mammospheres, soft agar colonies, and tumors more efficiently. These findings illustrate a direct link between the EMT and the gain of epithelial stem cell properties.}},

@article{Trimnell2009Genetically,
    abstract = {The production of IFN-{gamma} by CD8+ T cells is an important hallmark of protective immunity induced by irradiation-attenuated sporozoites against malaria. Here, we demonstrate that protracted sterile protection conferred by a Plasmodium yoelii genetically attenuated parasite (PyGAP) vaccine was completely dependent on CD8+ T lymphocytes but only partially dependent on IFN-{gamma}. We used live cell imaging to document that CD8+ CTL from PyGAP-immunized mice directly killed hepatocyte infected with a liver stage parasite. Immunization studies with perforin and IFN-{gamma} knockout mice also indicated that the protection was largely dependent on perforin-mediated effector mechanisms rather than on IFN-{gamma}. This was further supported by our observation that both liver and spleen CD8+ T cells from PyGAP-immunized mice induced massive apoptosis of liver stage-infected hepatocytes in vitro without the release of detectable IFN-{gamma} and TNF-{alpha}. Conversely, CD8+ T cells isolated from naive mice that had survived wild-type P. yoelii sporozoite infection targeted mainly sporozoite-traversed and uninfected hepatocytes, revealing an immune evasion strategy that might be used by wild-type parasites to subvert host immune responses during natural infection. However, CTLs from wild-type sporozoite-challenged mice could recognize and kill infected hepatocytes that were pulsed with circumsporozoite protein. Additionally, protection in PyGAP-immunized mice directly correlated with the magnitude of effector memory CD8+ T cells. Our findings implicate CTLs as key immune effectors in a highly protective PyGAP vaccine for malaria and emphasize the critical need to define surrogate markers for correlates of protection, apart from IFN-{gamma}. 10.4049/jimmunol.0900302},

We consider the problem of solving for point correspondences when the shapes of interest are each defined by a single, closed contour. A modification of the standard assignment problem is proposed whereby the correspondences are required to preserve the ordering of the points induced from the shapes' contours. Enforcement of this constraint leads to significantly improved correspondences. Robustness with respect to outliers and shape irregularity is obtained by required only a fraction of feature points to be matched. Furthermore, the minimum matching size may be specified in advance. We present efficient dynamic programming algorithms to solve the proposed optimization problem.

To investigate the global dynamical properties and stabilities of such networks, we studied the cell-cycle regulatory network of the budding yeast. With the use of a simple dynamical model, it was demonstrated that the cell-cycle network is extremely stable and robust for its function. The biological stationary state, the G1 state, is a global attractor of the dynamics. The biological pathway, the cell-cycle sequence of protein states, is a globally attracting trajectory of the dynamics. These properties are largely preserved with respect to small perturbations to the network. These results suggest that cellular regulatory networks are robustly designed for their functions.}},

It typically involves cell–cell communication and intracellular signal processing. Here we show a synthetic multicellular system in which genetically engineered 'receiver' cells are programmed to form ring-like patterns of differentiation based on chemical gradients of an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal that is synthesized by 'sender' cells. In receiver cells, 'band-detect' gene networks respond to user-defined ranges of AHL concentrations. By fusing different fluorescent proteins as outputs of network variants, an initially undifferentiated 'lawn' of receivers is engineered to form a bullseye pattern around a sender colony. Other patterns, such as ellipses and clovers, are achieved by placing senders in different configurations. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal which kinetic parameters most significantly affect ring development over time. Construction and study of such synthetic multicellular systems can improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring developmental processes and may foster applications in tissue engineering, biomaterial fabrication and biosensing.}},

@article{Oliveri2008Global,
    abstract = {{Explanation of a process of development must ultimately be couched in the terms of the genomic regulatory code. Specification of an embryonic cell lineage is driven by a network of interactions among genes encoding transcription factors. Here, we present the gene regulatory network (GRN) that directs the specification of the skeletogenic micromere lineage of the sea urchin embryo. The GRN now includes all regulatory genes expressed in this lineage up to late blastula stage, as identified in a genomewide survey. The architecture of the GRN was established by a large-scale perturbation analysis in which the expression of each gene in the GRN was cut off by use of morpholinos, and the effects on all other genes were measured quantitatively. Several cis-regulatory analyses provided additional evidence. The explanatory power of the GRN suffices to provide a causal explanation for all observable developmental functions of the micromere lineage during the specification period. These functions are: (i) initial acquisition of identity through transcriptional interpretation of localized maternal cues; (ii) activation of specific regulatory genes by use of a double negative gate; (iii) dynamic stabilization of the regulatory state by activation of a feedback subcircuit; (iv) exclusion of alternative regulatory states; (v) presentation of a signal required by the micromeres themselves and of two different signals required for development of adjacent endomesodermal lineages; and (vi) lineage-specific activation of batteries of skeletogenic genes. The GRN precisely predicts gene expression responses and provides a coherent explanation of the biology of specification.}},

In particular, using high-throughput gene expression assays, we are able to measure the output of the gene regulatory network. We aim here to review datamining and modeling approaches for conceptualizing and unraveling the functional relationships implicit in these datasets. Clustering of co-expression profiles allows us to infer shared regulatory inputs and functional pathways. We discuss various aspects of clustering, ranging from distance measures to clustering algorithms and multiple-cluster memberships. More advanced analysis aims to infer causal connections between genes directly, i.e. who is regulating whom and how. We discuss several approaches to the problem of reverse engineering of genetic networks, from discrete Boolean networks, to continuous linear and non-linear models. We conclude that the combination of predictive modeling with systematic experimental verification will be required to gain a deeper insight into living organisms, therapeutic targeting and bioengineering.}},

Discovery of organizing principles of biological networks can be enhanced by embracing the notion that there is a deep interplay between network structure and system dynamics. Recently, many structural characteristics of these non-random networks have been identified, but dynamical implications of the features have not been explored comprehensively. We demonstrate by exhaustive computational analysis that a dynamical property—stability or robustness to small perturbations—is highly correlated with the relative abundance of small subnetworks (network motifs) in several previously determined biological networks. We propose that robust dynamical stability is an influential property that can determine the non-random structure of biological networks.}},

In wild Saccharomyces flor yeasts, a particularly expanded FLO11 allele also confers to these yeasts the ability to float under stressing liquid environments. We report here that, under optimal laboratory conditions, the repeats domain of the FLO11 gene in these wild yeasts is extremely unstable. Changes in length in the FLO11 coding repeats domain affected Flo11p-associated functions but, interestingly, some of these functions were affected more than others. Therefore, length variations in this single gene provide a combinatorial diversity, which may contribute to a very rapid adaptation to fluctuating environments. Functional analysis of contracted alleles indicated that buoyancy was not associated to FLO11 length. In contrast, this property depended on the different types of repetitive units found in this gene. Thus, not only variations in the number of intragenic repeats but also the abundance and/or distribution of the different repetitive units may have phenotypic and evolutionary implications.

somatic cells to express a pluripotent stem cell
phenotype (iPS, induced pluripotent stem cell) and the

features of cell fate regulation that lie beyond

be generated. This apparent paradox, however, is
naturally explained by the rugged ''epigenetic landscape''

attractor states that emerge from the dynamical constraints
of the gene regulatory network. This article provides
a pedagogical primer to the fundamental principles
of gene regulatory networks as integrated dynamic systems
and reviews recent insights in gene expression
noise and fate determination, thereby offering a formal
framework that may help us to understand why cell fate
reprogramming events are inherently rare and yet so

    abstract = {{Although colonies from Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strains are smooth, those isolated from nature exhibit a structured fluffy pattern. Environmental scanning electron microscopy shows that the cells within wild fluffy colonies are connected by extracellular matrix (ECM) material. This material contains a protein of about 200 kDa unrelated to the flocculins, proteins involved in cell–cell adhesion in liquid media. The matrix material binds to concanavalin A. Within a few passages on rich agar medium, the wild strains switch from the fluffy to the smooth colony morphology. This domestication is accompanied by loss of the ECM and by extensive changes in gene expression as detected by DNA microarrays. The expression of about 320 genes was changed in smooth colonies. The major changes comprise carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall, water channels, Ty-transposons and subtelomeric genes, iron homeostasis, vitamin metabolism and cell cycle and polarity. The growth in fluffy colonies may represent a metabolic strategy for survival of yeast under unfavourable conditions that is switched off under felicitous laboratory conditions.}},

These cultures are grown under optimized laboratory conditions and allow us to study microorganisms as individuals. However, microorganisms naturally grow in conditions that are far from optimal, which causes them to become organized into multicellular communities that are better protected against the harmful environment. Moreover, this multicellular existence allows individual cells to differentiate and acquire specific properties, such as forming resistant spores, which benefit the whole population. The relocation of natural microorganisms to the laboratory can result in their adaptation to these favourable conditions, which is accompanied by complex changes that include the repression of some protective mechanisms that are essential in nature. Laboratory microorganisms that have been cultured for long periods under optimized conditions might therefore differ markedly from those that exist in natural ecosystems.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract—A common approach to determining corresponding
points on two shapes is to compute the cost of each possible pairing
of points and solve the assignment problem (weighted bipartite
matching) for the resulting cost matrix. We consider the problem
of solving for point correspondences when the shapes of interest
are each defined by a single, closed contour. A modification of the
standard assignment problem is proposed whereby the correspondences
are required to preserve the ordering of the points induced
from the shapes' contours. Enforcement of this constraint leads to
significantly improved correspondences. Robustness with respect
to outliers and shape irregularity is obtained by required only a
fraction of feature points to be matched. Furthermore, the minimum
matching size may be specified in advance. We present efficient
dynamic programming algorithms to solve the proposed optimization
problem. Experiments on the Brown and MPEG-7 shape
databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
relative to the standard assignment problem.

The Extended Potts Model employs clustered points on a grid to represent subdivided cells with probabilistic displacement of cell boundaries such that small changes in energy drive gradual tissue development. For modeling convergent extension, simulations include anisotropic differential adhesion: the degree of attachment between adjacent elongated cells depends on their relative orientation. Without considering additional mechanisms, simulations based on anisotropic differential adhesion reproduce the hallmark stages of convergent extension in the correct sequence, with random fluctuations as sufficient impetus for cell reorganization.}},

@article{Ni2001Genomic,
    abstract = {{A genome-wide screen of 4168 homozygous diploid yeast deletion strains has been performed to identify nonessential genes that participate in the bipolar budding pattern. By examining bud scar patterns representing the sites of previous cell divisions, 127 mutants representing three different phenotypes were found: unipolar, axial-like, and random. From this screen, 11 functional classes of known genes were identified, including those involved in actin-cytoskeleton organization, general bud site selection, cell polarity, vesicular transport, cell wall synthesis, protein modification, transcription, nuclear function, translation, and other functions. Four characterized genes that were not known previously to participate in bud site selection were also found to be important for the haploid axial budding pattern. In addition to known genes, we found 22 novel genes (20 are designated BUD13-BUD32) important for bud site selection. Deletion of one resulted in unipolar budding exclusively from the proximal pole, suggesting that this gene plays an important role in diploid distal budding. Mutations in 20 other novel BUD genes produced a random budding phenotype and one produced an axial-like budding defect. Several of the novel Bud proteins were fused to green fluorescence protein; two proteins were found to localize to sites of polarized cell growth (i.e., the bud tip in small budded cells and the neck in cells undergoing cytokinesis), similar to that postulated for the bipolar signals and proteins that target cell division site tags to their proper location in the cell. Four others localized to the nucleus, suggesting that they play a role in gene expression. The bipolar distal marker Bud8 was localized in a number of mutants; many showed an altered Bud8-green fluorescence protein localization pattern. Through the genome-wide identification and analysis of different mutants involved in bipolar bud site selection, an integrated pathway for this process is presented in which proximal and distal bud site selection tags are synthesized and localized at their appropriate poles, thereby directing growth at those sites. Genome-wide screens of defined collections of mutants hold significant promise for dissecting many biological processes in yeast.}},

@article{Chant1995Patterns,
    abstract = {{10.1083/jcb.129.3.751 Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae select bud sites in either of two distinct spatial patterns, known as axial (expressed by a and alpha cells) and bipolar (expressed by a/alpha cells). Fluorescence, time-lapse, and scanning electron microscopy have been used to obtain more precise descriptions of these patterns. From these descriptions, we conclude that in the axial pattern, the new bud forms directly adjacent to the division site in daughter cells and directly adjacent to the immediately preceding division site (bud site) in mother cells, with little influence from earlier sites. Thus, the division site appears to be marked by a spatial signal(s) that specifies the location of the new bud site and is transient in that it only lasts from one budding event to the next. Consistent with this conclusion, starvation and refeeding of axially budding cells results in the formation of new buds at nonaxial sites. In contrast, in bipolar budding cells, both poles are specified persistently as potential bud sites, as shown by the observations that a pole remains competent for budding even after several generations of nonuse and that the poles continue to be used for budding after starvation and refeeding. It appears that the specification of the two poles as potential bud sites occurs before a daughter cell forms its first bud, as a daughter can form this bud near either pole. However, there is a bias towards use of the pole distal to the division site. The strength of this bias varies from strain to strain, is affected by growth conditions, and diminishes in successive cell cycles. The first bud that forms near the distal pole appears to form at the very tip of the cell, whereas the first bud that forms near the pole proximal to the original division site (as marked by the birth scar) is generally somewhat offset from the tip and adjacent to (or overlapping) the birth scar. Subsequent buds can form near either pole and appear almost always to be adjacent either to the birth scar or to a previous bud site. These observations suggest that the distal tip of the cell and each division site carry persistent signals that can direct the selection of a bud site in any subsequent cell cycle. ER -  }},

Under standard conditions, colony morphology is specific to the particular yeast strain, which indicates that reproducibility of the structure appears to be a hallmark of programmed development. Our data indicate that markedly structured morphology of colonies formed by some haploid and diploid  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  strains is linked to formation of clusters of incompletely separated yeast cells organized into larger aggregates. A prerequisite to aggregate formation appears to be a monopolar budding pattern and the presence of an extracellular matrix and adhesins connecting individual clusters within aggregates. In contrast, less structured colonies of other strains are composed of non-aggregated cells exhibiting different modes of budding (axial/polar/random) in different colony areas. The budding pattern appears to be influenced more by the environment (the presence of surrounding cells, nutrient gradients, etc.) than by strain ploidy. Disruption of the  BUD2  gene results in uniform random budding of cells and it partially influences colony morphology.}},

    abstract = {{To achieve high throughput with robotic systems based on optical microscopy, it is necessary to replace the human observer with computer vision algorithms that can identify and localize individual cells as well as carry out additional studies on these cells in relation to biochemical parameters. The latter task is best accomplished with the use of fluorescent probes. Since the number of fluorescence channels is limited, it is highly desirable to accomplish the cell identification and localization task with transmitted light microscopy. In previous work, we developed algorithms for automatic detection of unstained cells of a single type in bright field images [X. Long, W.L. Cleveland, Y.L. Yao, A new preprocessing approach for cell recognition, IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine 9 (3) (2005) 407–412; X. Long, W.L. Cleveland, Y.L. Yao, Automatic detection of unstained viable cells in bright field images using a support vector machine with an improved training procedure, Computers in Biology and Medicine 36 (2006) 339–362]. Here we extend this technology to facilitate identification and localization of multiple cell types. We formulate the detection of multiple cell types in mixtures as a supervised, multiclass pattern recognition problem and solve it by extension of the Error Correcting Output Coding (ECOC) method to enable probability estimation. The use of probability estimation provides both cell type identification as well as cell localization relative to pixel coordinates. Our approach has been systematically studied under different overlap conditions and outperforms several commonly used methods, primarily due to the reduction of inconsistent labeling by introducing redundancy. Its speed and accuracy are sufficient for use in some practical systems.}},

Most research in this area has understandably concentrated on the selection stage of EAs, due to the need to integrate vectorial performance measures with the inherently scalar way in which EAs reward individual performance, that is, number of offspring. In this review, current multiobjective evolutionary approaches are discussed, ranging from the conventional analytical aggregation of the different objectives into a single function to a number of population-based approaches and the more recent ranking schemes based on the definition of Pareto optimality. The sensitivity of different methods to objective scaling and/or possible concavities in the trade-off surface is considered, and related to the (static) fitness landscapes such methods induce on the search space. From the discussion, directions for future research in multiobjective fitness assignment and search strategies are identified, including the incorporation of decision making in the selection procedure, fitness sharing, and adaptive representations.}},

@article{Keranen2004Simulation,
    abstract = {{The developmental increase in structural complexity in multicellular lifeforms depends on local, often non-periodic differences in gene expression. These, in turn, depend on a network of gene-gene interactions coded within the organismal genome. To see what architectural features of a network (size, connectivity, etc.) affect the likelihood of patterns with multiple cell types (i.e. patterns where cells express > or = 3 different combinations of genes), developmental pattern formation was simulated in virtual blastoderm embryos with small artificial genomes. Several basic properties of these genomic signaling networks, such as the number of genes, the distributions of positive (inductive) and negative (repressive) interactions, and the strengths of gene-gene interactions were tested. The results show that the frequencies of complex and/or stable patterns depended not only on the existence of negative interactions, but also on the distribution of regulatory interactions: for example, coregulation of signals and their intracellular effectors increased the likelihood of pattern formation compared to differential regulation of signaling pathway components. Interestingly, neither quantitative differences in strengths of signaling interactions nor multiple response thresholds to different levels of signal concentration (as in morphogen gradients) were essential for formation of multiple, spatially unique "cell types". However, those combinations of architectural features that greatly increased the likelihood for pattern complexity tended to decrease the likelihoods for pattern stability and developmental robustness. Nevertheless, elements of complex patterns (e.g. genes, cell type order within the pattern) could differ in their developmental robustness, which may be important for the evolution of complexity. The results show that depending on the network structure, the same set of genes can produce patterns of different complexity, robustness and stability. Because of this, the evolution of metazoan complexity with a combinatorial code of gene regulation may have depended at least as much on selection for favorable distribution of connections between existing developmental regulatory genes as on the simple increase in numbers of regulatory genes.}},

@article{Soyer2006Evolution,
    abstract = {{It is not clear how biological pathways evolve to mediate a certain physiological response and why they show a level of complexity that is generally above the minimum required to achieve such a response. One possibility is that pathway complexity increases due to the nature of evolutionary mechanisms. Here, we analyze this possibility by using mathematical models of biological pathways and evolutionary simulations. Starting with a population of small pathways of three proteins, we let the population evolve with mutations that affect pathway structure through duplication or deletion of existing proteins, deletion or creation of interactions among them, or addition of new proteins. Our simulations show that such mutational events, coupled with a selective pressure, leads to growth of pathways. These results indicate that pathways could be driven toward complexity via simple evolutionary mechanisms and that complexity can arise without any specific selective pressure for it. Furthermore, we find that the level of complexity that pathways evolve toward depends on the selection criteria. In general, we find that final pathway size tends to be lower when pathways evolve under stringent selection criteria. This leads to the counterintuitive conclusion that simple response requirements on a pathway would facilitate its evolution toward higher complexity.}},

Drugs that induce vascular normalization can alleviate hypoxia and increase the efficacy of conventional therapies if both are carefully scheduled.

@article{Doya2000Reinforcement,
    abstract = {{This article presents a reinforcement learning framework for continuous-time dynamical systems without a priori discretization of time, state, and action. Basedonthe Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for infinite-horizon, discounted reward problems, we derive algorithms for estimating value functions and improving policies with the use of function approximators. The process of value function estimation is formulated as the minimization of a continuous-time form of the temporal difference (TD) error. Update methods based on backward Euler approximation and exponential eligibility traces are derived, and their correspondences with the conventional residual gradient, TD (0), and TD (?) algorithms are shown. For policy improvement, two methods?a continuous actor-critic method and a value-gradient-based greedy policy?are formulated. As a special case of the latter, a nonlinear feedback control law using the value gradient and the model of the input gain is derived. The advantage updating, a model-free algorithm derived previously, is also formulated in the HJB-based framework. The performance of the proposed algorithms is first tested in a nonlinear control task of swinging a pendulum up with limited torque. It is shown in the simulations that (1) the task is accomplished by the continuous actor-critic method in a number of trials several times fewer than by the conventional discrete actor-critic method; (2) among the continuous policy update methods, the value-gradient-based policy with a known or learned dynamic model performs several times better than the actor-critic method; and (3) a value function update using exponential eligibility traces is more efficient and stable than that based on Euler approximation. The algorithms are then tested in a higher-dimensional task: cart-pole swing-up. This task is accomplished in several hundred trials using the value-gradient-based policy with a learned dynamic model.}},

@article{Merks2005Cellcentered,
    abstract = {{Explaining embryonic development of multicellular organisms requires insight into complex interactions between genetic regulation and physical, generic mechanisms at multiple scales. As more physicists move into developmental biology, we need to be aware of the  ” cultural” differences between the two fields, whose concepts of  ” explanations” and  ” models” traditionally differ: biologists aiming to identify genetic pathways and expression patterns, physicists tending to look for generic underlying principles. Here we discuss how we can combine such biological and physical approaches into a cell-centered approach to developmental biology. Genetic information can only indirectly influence the morphology and physiology of multicellular organisms. DNA translates into proteins and regulatory RNA sequences, which steer the biophysical properties of cells, their response to signals from neighboring cells, and the production and properties of extracellular matrix (ECM). We argue that in many aspects of biological development, cells' inner workings are irrelevant: what matter are the cell's biophysical properties, the signals it emits and its responses to extracellular signals. Thus we can separate questions about genetic regulation from questions about development. First, we ask what effects a gene network has on cell phenomenology, and how it operates. We then ask through which mechanisms such single-cell phenomenology directs multicellular morphogenesis and physiology. This approach treats the cell as the fundamental module of development. We discuss how this cell-centered approach—which requires significant input from computational biophysics—can assist and supplement experimental research in developmental biology. We review cell-centered approaches, focusing in particular on the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), and present the Tissue Simulation Toolkit which implements the CPM.}},

This study presents evidence that Dishevelled serves a similar function in the Ciona notochord. Embryos transgenic for mutant Dishevelled fail to elongate their tails, and notochord cells fail to intercalate, though notochord cell fates are unaffected. Analysis of mosaic transgenics revealed that the effects of mutant Dishevelled on notochord intercalation are cell-autonomous in Ciona, though such defects have nonautonomous effects in Xenopus. Furthermore, our data indicate that notochord cell intercalation in Ciona does not require the progressive signals which coordinate cell intercalation in the Xenopus notochord, highlighting an important difference in how mediolateral cell intercalation is controlled in the two animals. Finally, this study establishes the Ciona embryo as an effective in vivo system for the study of the molecular control of morphogenetic cell movements in chordates.}},

    abstract = {{Motivation: Diffusable and non-diffusable gene products play a major role in body plan formation. A quantitative understanding of the spatio-temporal patterns formed in body plan formation, by using simulation models is an important addition to experimental observation. The inverse modelling approach consists of describing the body plan formation by a rule-based model, and fitting the model parameters to real observed data. In body plan formation, the data are usually obtained from fluorescent immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridizations. Inferring model parameters by comparing such data to those from simulation is a major computational bottleneck. An important aspect in this process is the choice of method used for parameter estimation. When no information on parameters is available, parameter estimation is mostly done by means of heuristic algorithms.Results: We show that parameter estimation for pattern formation models can be efficiently performed using an evolution strategy (ES). As a case study we use a quantitative spatio-temporal model of the regulatory network for early development in Drosophila melanogaster. In order to estimate the parameters, the simulated results are compared to a time series of gene products involved in the network obtained with immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate that a (μ,λ)-ES can be used to find good quality solutions in the parameter estimation. We also show that an ES with multiple populations is 5–140 times as fast as parallel simulated annealing for this case study, and that combining ES with a local search results in an efficient parameter estimation method.Supplementary information and availability: Bioinformatics online; software: http://www.science.uva.nl/research/scs/3D-RegNet/fly\_eaContact: jaapk@science.uva.nl}},

This is, then, a system identification problem, that is commonly addressed by running a model with estimated parameters and assessing how far the model's behaviour is from the 'target' behaviour of the variables, and adjusting parameters iteratively until a good fit is achieved. The issue is that most of these problems are grossly underdetermined, such that many combinations of parameters can be used to fit a given set of variables. We introduce the constraint that the estimated parameters should be within given bounds and as close as possible to stated nominal values. This deterministic 'proximate parameter tuning' algorithm turns out to be exceptionally effective, and we illustrate its utility for models of p38 signalling, of yeast glycolysis and for a benchmark dataset describing the thermal isomerisation of [small alpha]-pinene.}},

Here we describe a generic approach to combine numerical optimization methods with biochemical kinetic simulations, which is suitable for use in the rational design of improved metabolic pathways with industrial significance (metabolic engineering) and for solving the inverse problem of metabolic pathways, i.e. the estimation of parameters from measured variables. RESULTS: We discuss the suitability of various optimization methods, focusing especially on their ability or otherwise to find global optima. We recommend that a suite of diverse optimization methods should be available in simulation software as no single one performs best for all problems. We describe how we have implemented such a simulation-optimization strategy in the biochemical kinetics simulator Gepasi and present examples of its application. AVAILABILITY: The new version of Gepasi (3.20), incorporating the methodology described here, is available on the Internet at http://gepasi.dbs.aber.ac.uk/softw/Gepasi. html.

    abstract = {{A distinguishing feature of a multicellular living system is that it operates at various scales, from the intracellular to organismal. Genes and molecules set up the conditions for the physical processes to act, in particular to shape the embryo. As development continues the changes brought about by the physical processes lead to changes in gene expression. It is this coordinated interplay between genetic and generic (i.e., physical and chemical) processes that constitutes the modern understanding of early morphogenesis. It is natural to assume that in this multiscale process the smaller defines the larger. In case of biophysical properties, in particular, those at the subcellular level are expected to give rise to those at the tissue level and beyond. Indeed, the physical properties of tissues vary greatly from the liquid to solid. Very little is known at present on how tissue level properties are related to cell and subcellular properties. Modern measurement techniques provide quantitative results at both the intracellular and tissue level, but not on the connection between these. In the present work we outline a framework to address this connection. We specifically concentrate on the morphogenetic process of tissue fusion, by following the coalescence of two contiguous multicellular aggregates. The time evolution of this process can accurately be described by the theory of viscous liquids. We also study fusion by Monte Carlo simulations and a novel Cellular Particle Dynamics (CPD) model, which is similar to the earlier introduced Subcellular Element Model (SEM; Newman, 2005). Using the combination of experiments, theory and modeling we are able to relate the measured tissue level biophysical quantities to subcellular parameters. Our approach has validity beyond the particular morphogenetic process considered here and provides a general way to relate biophysical properties across scales.}},

@article{Ernst2007Reconstructing,
    abstract = {{Even simple organisms have the ability to respond to internal and external stimuli. This response is carried out by a dynamic network of protein–DNA interactions that allows the specific regulation of genes needed for the response. We have developed a novel computational method that uses an input–output hidden Markov model to model these regulatory networks while taking into account their dynamic nature. Our method works by identifying bifurcation points, places in the time series where the expression of a subset of genes diverges from the rest of the genes. These points are annotated with the transcription factors regulating these transitions resulting in a unified temporal map. Applying our method to study yeast response to stress, we derive dynamic models that are able to recover many of the known aspects of these responses. Predictions made by our method have been experimentally validated leading to new roles for Ino4 and Gcn4 in controlling yeast response to stress. The temporal cascade of factors reveals common pathways and highlights differences between master and secondary factors in the utilization of network motifs and in condition-specific regulation.}},

@article{Veflingstad2004Priming,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Dense time series of metabolite concentrations or of the expression patterns of proteins may be available in the near future as a result of the rapid development of novel, high-throughput experimental techniques. Such time series implicitly contain valuable information about the connectivity and regulatory structure of the underlying metabolic or proteomic networks. The extraction of this information is a challenging task because it usually requires nonlinear estimation methods that involve iterative search algorithms. Priming these algorithms with high-quality initial guesses can greatly accelerate the search process. In this article, we propose to obtain such guesses by preprocessing the temporal profile data and fitting them preliminarily by multivariate linear regression.RESULTS:The results of a small-scale analysis indicate that the regression coefficients reflect the connectivity of the network quite well. Using the mathematical modeling framework of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST), we also show that the regression coefficients may be translated into constraints on the parameter values of the nonlinear BST model, thereby reducing the parameter search space considerably.CONCLUSION:The proposed method provides a good approach for obtaining a preliminary network structure from dense time series. This will be more valuable as the systems become larger, because preprocessing and effective priming can significantly limit the search space of parameters defining the network connectivity, thereby facilitating the nonlinear estimation task.}},

@article{Weber2008Optimization,
    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This mathematical contribution is addressed towards the wide interface of life and human sciences that exists between biological and environmental information. Like very few other disciplines only, the modeling and prediction of genetical data is requesting mathematics nowadays to deeply understand its foundations. This need is even forced by the rapid changes in a world of globalization. Such a study has to include aspects of stability and tractability; the still existing limitations of modern technology in terms of measurement errors and uncertainty have to be taken into account. In this paper, the important role played by the environment is rigorously introduced into the biological context and connected with employing the theories of optimization and dynamical systems. Especially, a matrix-vector and interval concept and algebra are used; some special attention is paid to splines. From data got by DNA microarray experiments and environmental measurements we extract nonlinear ordinary differential equations. This is done by Chebychev approximation and semi-infinite optimization. Then, time-discretized dynamical systems are studied. By a combinatorial algorithm which constructs and follows polyhedra sequences, the region of parametric stability is detected. This is used for testing and maybe improving the goodness of the achieved model. We analyze the topological landscape of gene-environment networks in terms of structural stability which we characterize. This pioneering practically motivated and theoretically elaborated work is devoted to a contribution to better health care, progress in medicine, better education, and to recommending more healthy living conditions. The present paper mainly bases on the authors' and their coauthors' contributions of the last few years, it critically discusses structural frontiers and future challenges, while respecting related research contributions, giving access and referring to alternative concepts that exist in the literature.}},

@article{Mehta2009Information,
    abstract = {{Bacteria communicate using secreted chemical signaling molecules called autoinducers in a process known as quorum sensing. The quorum-sensing network of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi uses three autoinducers, each known to encode distinct ecological information. Yet how cells integrate and interpret the information contained within these three autoinducer signals remains a mystery. Here, we develop a new framework for analyzing signal integration on the basis of information theory and use it to analyze quorum sensing in V. harveyi. We quantify how much the cells can learn about individual autoinducers and explain the experimentally observed input–output relation of the V. harveyi quorum-sensing circuit. Our results suggest that the need to limit interference between input signals places strong constraints on the architecture of bacterial signal-integration networks, and that bacteria probably have evolved active strategies for minimizing this interference. Here, we analyze two such strategies: manipulation of autoinducer production and feedback on receptor number ratios.}},

    abstract = {{Systems biology aims to develop mathematical models of biological systems by integrating experimental and theoretical techniques. During the last decade, many systems biological approaches that base on genome-wide data have been developed to unravel the complexity of gene regulation. This review deals with the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from experimental data through computational methods. Standard GRN inference methods primarily use gene expression data derived from microarrays. However, the incorporation of additional information from heterogeneous data sources, e.g. genome sequence and protein-DNA interaction data, clearly supports the network inference process. This review focuses on promising modelling approaches that use such diverse types of molecular biological information. In particular, approaches are discussed that enable the modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory systems. The review provides an overview of common modelling schemes and learning algorithms and outlines current challenges in GRN modelling.}},

    abstract = {{Genome-scale analysis of predicted metabolic pathways has revealed the common occurrence of apparent redundancy for specific functional units, or metabolic modules. In many cases, mutation analysis does not resolve function, and instead, direct experimental analysis of metabolic flux under changing conditions is necessary. In order to use genome sequences to build models of cellular function, it is important to define function for such apparently redundant systems. Here we describe direct flux measurements to determine the role of redundancy in three modules involved in formaldehyde assimilation and dissimilation in a bacterium growing on methanol. A combination of deuterium and 14C labeling was used to measure the flux through each of the branches of metabolism for growth on methanol during transitions into and out of methylotrophy. The cells were found to differentially partition formaldehyde among the three modules depending on the flux of methanol into the cell. A dynamic mathematical model demonstrated that the kinetic constants of the enzymes involved are sufficient to account for this phenomenon. We demonstrate the role of redundancy in formaldehyde metabolism and have uncovered a new paradigm for coping with toxic, high-flux metabolic intermediates: a dynamic, interconnected metabolic loop.}},

@article{Bentley2009Tipping,
    abstract = {{Vascular abnormalities contribute to many diseases such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy. In angiogenesis new blood vessels, headed by a migrating tip cell, sprout from pre-existing vessels in response to signals, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Tip cells meet and fuse (anastomosis) to form blood-flow supporting loops. Tip cell selection is achieved by Dll4-Notch mediated lateral inhibition resulting, under normal conditions, in an interleaved arrangement of tip and non-migrating stalk cells. Previously, we showed that the increased VEGF levels found in many diseases can cause the delayed negative feedback of lateral inhibition to produce abnormal oscillations of tip/stalk cell fates. Here we describe the development and implementation of a novel physics-based hierarchical agent model, tightly coupled to in vivo data, to explore the system dynamics as perpetual lateral inhibition combines with tip cell migration and fusion. We explore the tipping point between normal and abnormal sprouting as VEGF increases. A novel filopodia-adhesion driven migration mechanism is presented and validated against in vivo data. Due to the unique feature of ongoing lateral inhibition, 'stabilised' tip/stalk cell patterns show sensitivity to the formation of new cell-cell junctions during fusion: we predict cell fates can reverse. The fusing tip cells become inhibited and neighbouring stalk cells flip fate, recursively providing new tip cells. Junction size emerges as a key factor in establishing a stable tip/stalk pattern. Cell-cell junctions elongate as tip cells migrate, which is shown to provide positive feedback to lateral inhibition, causing it to be more susceptible to pathological oscillations. Importantly, down-regulation of the migratory pathway alone is shown to be sufficient to rescue the sprouting system from oscillation and restore stability. Thus we suggest the use of migration inhibitors as therapeutic agents for vascular normalisation in cancer. Abnormal vasculature exacerbates many diseases such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy. In angiogenesis new blood vessels, headed by a migrating tip cell, sprout from pre-existing vessels in response to chemical signals. The signals are released from newly oxygen deficient tissue. The signals are known to be different in disease and are thought to cause the process of angiogenesis to progress abnormally, though the reasons for this remain unclear. Normalisation of angiogenesis has great potential as a therapeutic strategy; it has been shown to reduce metastasis and improve drug delivery in tumours. Here we focus on the behaviours of three inter-related initial angiogenic pathways associated with changes in tissue signal conditions, utilising both in silico and in vivo approaches. By the construction and implementation of a novel computational model for cell motility and signal processing we present a new theory on why angiogenesis exhibits such sensitivity to signal changes and show that the behaviour in disease is surprisingly more robust than normal functioning. This we attribute to the positive feedback of cell migration reinforcing abnormal oscillations in cell fate selection. We make the unique prediction that normalisation could be achieved by reducing cell migration alone.}},

@article{Glickman2003Shaping,
    abstract = {{Promptly after the notochord domain is specified in the vertebrate dorsal mesoderm, it undergoes dramatic morphogenesis. Beginning during gastrulation, convergence and extension movements change a squat cellular array into a narrow, elongated one that defines the primary axis of the embryo. Convergence and extension might be coupled by a highly organized cellular intermixing known as mediolateral intercalation behavior (MIB). To learn whether MIB drives early morphogenesis of the zebrafish notochord, we made 4D recordings and quantitatively analyzed both local cellular interactions and global changes in the shape of the dorsal mesodermal field. We show that MIB appears to mediate convergence and can account for extension throughout the dorsal mesoderm. Comparing the notochord and adjacent somitic mesoderm reveals that extension can be regulated separately from convergence. Moreover, mutational analysis shows that extension does not require convergence. Hence, a cellular machine separate from MIB that can drive dorsal mesodermal extension exists in the zebrafish gastrula. The likely redundant control of morphogenesis may provide for plasticity at this critical stage of early development.}},

    abstract = {{In recent years; experience has demonstrated that the classical fractal dimensions are not sufficient to describe uniquely the interstitial geometry of porous media. At least one additional index or dimension is necessary. Lacunarity; a measure of the degree to which a data set is translationally invariant; is a possible candidate. Unfortunately; several approaches exist to evaluate it on the basis of binary images of the object under study; and it is unclear to what extent the lacunarity estimates that these methods produce are dependent on the resolution of the images used. In the present work; the gliding-box algorithm of Allain and Cloitre [Phys. Rev. A  44 ; 3552 (1991)] and two variants of the sandbox algorithm of Chappard  et al.  [J. Pathol.  195 ; 515 (2001)]; along with three additional algorithms; are used to evaluate the lacunarity of images of a textbook fractal; the Sierpinski carpet; of scanning electron micrographs of a thin section of a European soil; and of light transmission photographs of a Togolese soil. The results suggest that lacunarity estimates; as well as the ranking of the three tested systems according to their lacunarity; are affected strongly by the algorithm used; by the resolution of the images to which these algorithms are applied; and; at least for three of the algorithms (producing scale-dependent lacunarity estimates); by the scale at which the images are observed. Depending on the conditions under which the estimation of the lacunarity is carried out; lacunarity values range from 1.02 to 2.14 for the three systems tested; and all three of the systems used can be viewed alternatively as the most or the least  ” lacunar.” Some of this indeterminacy and dependence on image resolution is alleviated in the averaged lacunarity estimates yielded by Chappard  et al. 's algorithm. Further research will be needed to determine if these lacunarity estimates allow an improved; unique characterization of porous media.}},

To date, there is no quantitative study investigating the effect of Tai Chi Chuan movement speed on leg muscle function. This study investigated the effect of Tai Chi Chuan exercise performed at different speed on leg muscle activity characteristics in both young and old Tai Chi Chuan practitioners. Surface electromyography of six leg muscles and kinematics of lower extremity joints were measured in young and old subjects during Tai Chi Chuan practice at fast, normal, and slow speed, respectively. The magnitude and duration of activation, and durations of isometric, concentric and eccentric actions of each muscle were compared among three speeds and between two groups. The activation duration of all six leg muscles was significantly longer at slower speed than at faster speed ( P  < 0.039). The durations of isometric, concentric and eccentric actions were either longer at the slower speed or did not change with speed for all six leg muscles. The action of knee extensor was primarily isometric at slower speed ( P  = 0.004), and increased significantly to concentric and eccentric at faster speed ( P  < 0.031). The activation magnitude of posterior leg muscles increased with speed ( P  < 0.009). The old subjects had significantly shorter activation duration and lower activation magnitude in several leg muscles than the young, but similar speed effect as the young. The activation duration and function of leg muscles, especially the knee extensor muscle, are significantly affected by the speed of the selected Tai Chi Chuan movement. Practicing Tai Chi Chuan at different speed may alter the role of muscular function in movement control.}},

Gene expression data from microarrays are typically used for this purpose. Here we compared different reverse-engineering algorithms for which ready-to-use software was available and that had been tested on experimental data sets. We show that reverse-engineering algorithms are indeed able to correctly infer regulatory interactions among genes, at least when one performs perturbation experiments complying with the algorithm requirements. These algorithms are superior to classic clustering algorithms for the purpose of finding regulatory interactions among genes, and, although further improvements are needed, have reached a discreet performance for being practically useful.}},

@article{Chan2003Kinematic,
    abstract = {{Background: Tai chi is a form of exercise derived from the martial art folk traditions of China. The force used in tai chi includes different principles of mechanical advantage. No studies on the kinematic features of tai chi exercise have been published.  Objective: To analyse the kinematics and electromyographic characteristics of tai chi.  Methods: An experienced tai chi master was asked to perform a sequence of basic movements: ward off, roll back, press, and push. The movements were videotaped and digitised using a motion analysis system. Electromyographic activities of the lumbar erector spinae, rectus femoris, medial hamstrings, and medial head of gastrocnemius were recorded by surface electrodes. The push movement data were analysed.  Results: The medial hamstrings and medial head of gastrocnemius muscle groups maintained low activity, with higher electromyographic values in the lumbar erector spinae and substantially higher ones in the rectus femoris during the push movement. Both concentric and eccentric contractions occurred in muscles of the lower limbs, with eccentric contraction occurring mainly in the anti-gravity muscles such as the rectus femoris and the medial head of gastrocnemius. The forward and backward shifts in centre of gravity (CG) were mainly accomplished by increasing and decreasing respectively the joint angles of the bilateral lower limbs rather than by adopting a forward or backward postural lean. The path of the CG in the anteroposterior and mediolateral component was unique, and the sway or deviation from the path was small. The master maintained an upright posture and maintained a low CG (hips, knees, and ankles bent) while travelling slowly and steadily from one position to another.  Conclusion: The eccentric muscle contraction of the lower limbs in the push movement of tai chi may help to strengthen the muscles. 10.1136/bjsm.37.4.339}},

The aim is to enhance CT tumor staging prediction accuracy through identifying malignant aggressiveness of lung tumors. As branching of blood vessels can be considered a fractal process, the research examines vascularized tumor regions that exhibit strong fractal characteristics. The analysis is performed after injecting 15 patients with a contrast agent and transforming at least 11 time sequence CE CT images from each patient to the fractal dimension and determining corresponding lacunarity. The fractal texture features were averaged over the tumor region and quantitative classification showed up to 83.3\% accuracy in distinction between advanced (aggressive) and early-stage (nonaggressive) malignant tumors. Also, it showed strong correlation with corresponding lung tumor stage and standardized tumor uptake value of fluoro deoxyglucose as determined by positron emission tomography. These results indicate that fractal analysis of time sequence CE CT images of malignant lung tumors could provide additional information about likely tumor aggression that could potentially impact on clinical management decisions in choosing the appropriate treatment procedure.}},

Studies from several groups present strong evidence that the fractal dimension of the blood vessels in the normal human retina is approximately 1.7. This is the same fractal dimension that is found for a diffusion-limited growth process, and it may have implications for the embryological development of the retinal vascular system. The methods of determining the fractal dimension for branching trees are reviewed together with proposed models for the optimal formation (Murray Principle) of the branching vascular tree in the human retina and the branching pattern of the human bronchial tree. The limitations of fractal analysis of branching biological structures are evaluated. Understanding the design principles of branching vascular systems and the human bronchial tree may find applications in tissue and organ engineering, i.e., bioartificial organs for both liver and kidney.}},

It was later shown that NRP1 is an isoform-specific receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), specifically VEGF. Much interest has been placed on the role of the various VEGF isoforms in vascular biology. Here we report that blocking NRP1 function, using a recently described antibody that inhibits VEGF binding to NRP1, surprisingly reduces VEGF-induced migration and sprout formation of endothelial cells. Intrigued by this observation, direct binding studies of NRP1 to various VEGF isoforms were performed. We show that VEGF binds directly to NRP1; however, unlike VEGF, VEGF is not sufficient to bridge the NRP1\^{A}·VEGFR2 complex. Additionally, we show that VEGFR2 enhances VEGF, but not VEGF binding to NRP1. We propose a new model for NRP1 interactions with various VEGF isoforms.}},

@article{Choudhary2006Intervention,
    abstract = {{Motivation: Intervention in a gene regulatory network is used to avoid undesirable states, such as those associated with a disease. Several types of intervention have been studied in the framework of a probabilistic Boolean network (PBN), which is a collection of Boolean networks in which the gene state vector transitions according to the rules of one of the constituent networks and where network choice is governed by a selection distribution. The theory of automatic control has been applied to find optimal strategies for manipulating external control variables that affect the transition probabilities to desirably affect dynamic evolution over a finite time horizon. In this paper we treat a case in which we lack the governing probability structure for Boolean network selection, so we simply have a family of Boolean networks, but where these networks possess a common attractor structure. This corresponds to the situation in which network construction is treated as an ill-posed inverse problem in which there are many Boolean networks created from the data under the constraint that they all possess attractor structures matching the data states, which are assumed to arise from sampling the steady state of the real biological network.  Results: Given a family of Boolean networks possessing a common attractor structure composed of singleton attractors, a control algorithm is derived by minimizing a composite finite-horizon cost function that is a weighted average over all the individual networks, the idea being that we desire a control policy that on average suits the networks because these are viewed as equivalent relative to the data. The weighting for each network at any time point is taken to be proportional to the instantaneous estimated probability of that network being the underlying network governing the state transition. The results are applied to a family of Boolean networks derived from gene-expression data collected in a study of metastatic melanoma, the intent being to devise a control strategy that reduces the WNT5A gene's action in affecting biological regulation.

We therefore briefly sum up why anti-migratory drugs constitute a promising approach in oncology while at the same time emphasizing that migrating cancer cells are resistant to apoptosis. To analyze the pros and cons of the various in vitro tests under review we also briefly sum up the molecular and cellular stages of cancer cell migration, an approach that enables us to argue both that no single in vitro test is sufficient to characterize the anti-migratory potential of a drug and that standardization is needed for the efficient quantitative analysis of cell locomotion in a 3D environment. Before concluding our review we devote the final two parts (i) to the description of new prototypes which, in the near future, could enter the screening process with a view to identifying novel anti-migratory compounds, and (ii) to the anti-migratory compounds currently developed against cancer, with particular emphasis on how these compounds were selected before entering the clinical trial phase. {\copyright} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

                Macrophages are versatile immune cells that can detect a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns through their Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In response to microbial challenge, the TLR-stimulated macrophage undergoes an activation program controlled by a dynamically inducible transcriptional regulatory network. Mapping a complex mammalian transcriptional network poses significant challenges and requires the integration of multiple experimental data types. In this work, we inferred a transcriptional network underlying TLR-stimulated murine macrophage activation. Microarray-based expression profiling and transcription factor binding site motif scanning were used to infer a network of associations between transcription factor genes and clusters of co-expressed target genes. The time-lagged correlation was used to analyze temporal expression data in order to identify potential causal influences in the network. A novel statistical test was developed to assess the significance of the time-lagged correlation. Several associations in the resulting inferred network were validated using targeted ChIP-on-chip experiments. The network incorporates known regulators and gives insight into the transcriptional control of macrophage activation. Our analysis identified a novel regulator (TGIF1) that may have a role in macrophage activation.

                Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,437,180 new cancer cases and 565,650 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2008. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality include stabilization of incidence rates for all cancer sites combined in men from 1995 through 2004 and in women from 1999 through 2004 and a continued decrease in the cancer death rate since 1990 in men and since 1991 in women. Overall cancer death rates in 2004 compared with 1990 in men and 1991 in women decreased by 18.4\% and 10.5\%, respectively, resulting in the avoidance of over a half million deaths from cancer during this time interval. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, education, geographic area, and calendar year, as well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. Although much progress has been made in reducing mortality rates, stabilizing incidence rates, and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries and by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.

Using morphological, cytochemical, genetic, and DNA microarray approaches, we characterized six temporal steps in the "acid-to-alkali" colony transition. This transition is connected with the production of volatile ammonia acting as starvation signal between colonies. We present evidence that the three membrane proteins Ato1p, Ato2p, and Ato3p, members of the YaaH family, are involved in ammonia production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae colonies. The acid-to-alkali transition is connected with decrease of mitochondrial oxidative catabolism and by peroxisome activation, which in parallel with activation of biosynthetic pathways contribute to decrease the general stress level in colonies. These metabolic features characterize a novel survival strategy used by yeast under starvation conditions prevalent in nature.}},

@article{Gerlee2007Stability,
    abstract = {{Cell colonies of bacteria, tumor cells, and fungi, under nutrient limited growth conditions, exhibit complex branched growth patterns. In order to investigate this phenomenon we present a simple hybrid cellular automaton model of cell colony growth. In the model the growth of the colony is limited by a nutrient that is consumed by the cells and which inhibits cell division if it falls below a certain threshold. Using this model we have investigated how the nutrient consumption rate of the cells affects the growth dynamics of the colony. We found that for low consumption rates the colony takes on an Eden-like morphology, while for higher consumption rates the morphology of the colony is branched with a fractal geometry. These findings are in agreement with previous results, but the simplicity of the model presented here allows for a linear stability analysis of the system. By observing that the local growth of the colony is proportional to the flux of the nutrient we derive an approximate dispersion relation for the growth of the colony interface. This dispersion relation shows that the stability of the growth depends on how far the nutrient penetrates into the colony. For low nutrient consumption rates the penetration distance is large, which stabilizes the growth, while for high consumption rates the penetration distance is small, which leads to unstable branched growth. When the penetration distance vanishes the dispersion relation is reduced to the one describing Laplacian growth without ultra-violet regularization. The dispersion relation was verified by measuring how the average branch width depends on the consumption rate of the cells and shows good agreement between theory and simulations.}},

@article{Cho2007SelfOrganization,
    abstract = {{Colonies of bacterial cells can display complex collective dynamics, frequently culminating in the formation of biofilms and other ordered super-structures. Recent studies suggest that to cope with local environmental challenges, bacterial cells can actively seek out small chambers or cavities and assemble there, engaging in quorum sensing behavior. By using a novel microfluidic device, we showed that within chambers of distinct shapes and sizes allowing continuous cell escape, bacterial colonies can gradually self-organize. The directions of orientation of cells, their growth, and collective motion are mutually correlated and dictated by the chamber walls and locations of chamber exits. The ultimate highly organized steady state is conducive to a more-organized escape of cells from the chambers and increased access of nutrients into and evacuation of waste out of the colonies. Using a computational model, we suggest that the lengths of the cells might be optimized to maximize self-organization while minimizing the potential for stampede-like exit blockage. The self-organization described here may be crucial for the early stage of the organization of high-density bacterial colonies populating small, physically confined growth niches. It suggests that this phenomenon can play a critical role in bacterial biofilm initiation and development of other complex multicellular bacterial super-structures, including those implicated in infectious diseases. Bacterial cells form colonies with complex organization (aka biofilms), particularly in response to hostile environmental conditions. Recent studies have shown that biofilm development occurs when bacterial cells seek out small cavities and populate them at high densities. However, bacteria in cavities may suffer from poor nutrient supply or waste removal, or disorganized expansion leading to blockage of cell escape. In this study, we observed Escherichia coli in a microfluidic device that allows direct observation of the growth and development of cell colonies in microchambers of different shapes and sizes through multiple generations. Combining this experimentation with computational analysis of colony growth and expansion, we characterize a process of colony self-organization that results in a high degree of correlation between the directions of cell orientation and growth of collective cell movement. We also find that this self-organization can significantly facilitate efficient escape of cells from the confines of cavities where they reside, while improving the access of nutrients into the colony interior. Finally, we suggest that the aspect ratio of the shape of E. coli and other similar bacteria might be generally subject to a constraint related to colony self-organization.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;To study the cellular functions of gene products, various yeast morphological mutants have been investigated. To describe yeast morphology objectively, we have developed image processing programs for budding and fission yeast. The programs, named CalMorph for budding yeast and F-CalMorph for fission yeast, directly process microscopic images and generate quantitative data about yeast cell shape, nuclear shape and location, and actin distribution. Using CalMorph, we can easily and quickly obtain various quantitative data reproducibly. To study the utility and reliability of CalMorph, we evaluated its data in three ways: (1) The programs extracted three-dimensional bud information from two-dimensional digital images with a low error rate (\&lt;1\%). (2) The absolute values of the diameters of manufactured fluorescent beads calculated with CalMorph were very close to those given in the manufacturer's data sheet. (3) The programs generated reproducible data consistent with that obtained by hand. Based on these results, we determined that CalMorph could monitor yeast morphological changes accompanied by the progression of the cell cycle. We discuss the potential of the CalMorph series as a novel tool for the analysis of yeast cell morphology.}},

@article{Dudley2005Global,
    abstract = {{Pleiotropy, the ability of a single mutant gene to cause multiple mutant phenotypes, is a relatively common but poorly understood phenomenon in biology. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the analysis of pleiotropic genes is determining whether phenotypes associated with a mutation result from the loss of a single function or of multiple functions encoded by the same gene. Here we estimate the degree of pleiotropy in yeast by measuring the phenotypes of 4710 mutants under 21 environmental conditions, finding that it is significantly higher than predicted by chance. We use a biclustering algorithm to group pleiotropic genes by common phenotype profiles. Comparisons of these clusters to biological process classifications, synthetic lethal interactions, and protein complex data support the hypothesis that this method can be used to genetically define cellular functions. Applying these functional classifications to pleiotropic genes, we are able to dissect phenotypes into groups associated with specific gene functions.}},

Analysis of fluorescent microscopic images of triple-stained cells makes it possible to treat morphological variations as quantitative traits. Deletion of nearly half of the yeast genes not essential for growth affects these morphological traits. Similar morphological phenotypes are caused by deletions of functionally related genes, enabling a functional assignment of a locus to a specific cellular pathway.

@article{Mauriz2008Antiangiogenic,
    abstract = {{Angiogenesis - process of new blood-vessel growth from existing vasculature - is an integral part of both normal developmental processes and numerous pathologies such as cancer, ischemic diseases and chronic inflammation. Angiogenesis plays a crucial role facilitating tumour growth and the metastatic process, and it is the result of a dynamic balance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. The potential to block tumour growth and metastases by angiogenesis inhibition represents an intriguing approach to the cancer treatment. Angiogenesis continues to be a topic of major scientific interest; and there are currently more antiangiogenic drugs in cancer clinical trials than those that fit into any other mechanistic category. Based on preclinical studies, researchers believe that targeting the blood vessels which support tumour growth could help treatment of a broad range of cancers. Angiogenic factors or their receptors, endothelial cell proliferation, matrix metalloproteinases or endothelial cell adhesion, are the main targets of an increasing number of clinical trials approved to test the tolerance and therapeutic efficacy of antiangiogenic agents. Unfortunately, contrary to initial expectations, it has been described that antiangiogenic treatment can cause different toxicities in cancer patients. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of current attempts to inhibit tumour angiogenesis for cancer therapy. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 97:4129-4154, 2008}},

@article{Morisada2006Angiopoietins,
    abstract = {{Vascular network formation requires several endothelial cell growth factors. These factors have a potent angiogenic effect, and their precise coordination is essential for vascular development. Among them, angiopoietins function through the Tie2 receptor, whose signaling is critical to regulate vascular stabilization and remodeling. It has been reported that the angiopoietin/Tie2 signal is involved in survival and migration of endothelial cells and regulates vascular remodeling and maintenance of vascular integrity. More recent studies demonstrate that angiopoietin/Tie2 signaling is also required for lymphangiogenesis. The authors and several other groups have identified six angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptls) containing a coiled-coil domain and a fibrinogen-like domain, both of which are characteristic of angiopoietins. Interestingly, Angptls also function in angiogenesis through regulating survival and migration of endothelial cells, although Angptls do not bind the angiopoietin receptor Tie2. Currently, Angptls are orphan ligands, but they have been reported to have pleiotropic effects not only on vascular cells but also on metabolism and tumor biology. Here, the authors review current findings relating to the roles of angiopoietins and Angptls in vascular biology and discuss molecular mechanisms relevant to these factors and angiogenesis.}},

@article{Mckay2008Selective,
    abstract = {PURPOSE. To quantify the effects of the steroid triamcinolone acetonide (TA) on branching morphology within the angiogenic microvascular tree of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of quail embryos.  METHODS. Increasing concentrations of TA (0-16 ng/mL) were applied topically on embryonic day (E) 7 to the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of quail embryos cultured in petri dishes and incubated for an additional 24 or 48 hours until fixation. Binary (black/white) microscopic images of arterial end points were quantified by generational analysis of vessel branching (VESGEN) software to obtain major vascular parameters that include vessel diameter (Dv), fractal dimension (Df), tortuosity (Tv), and densities of vessel area, length, number, and branch point (Av, Lv, Nv, and Brv). For assessment of specific changes in vascular morphology induced by TA, the VESGEN software automatically segmented the vascular tree into branching generations (G1... G10) according to changes in vessel diameter and branching.  RESULTS. Vessel density decreased significantly up to 34\% as the function of increasing concentration of TA according to Av, Lv, Brv, Nv, and Df. TA selectively inhibited the growth of new, small vessels because Lv decreased from 13.14 {+/-} 0.61 cm/cm2 for controls to 8.012 {+/-} 0.82 cm/cm2 at 16 ng TA/mL in smaller branching generations (G7-G10) and for Nv from 473.83 {+/-} 29.85 cm-2 to 302.32 {+/-} 33.09 cm-2. In contrast, vessel diameter (Dv) decreased throughout the vascular tree (G1-G10).  CONCLUSIONS. By VESGEN analysis, TA selectively inhibited the angiogenesis of smaller blood vessels, but decreased the vessel diameter of all vessels within the vascular tree. 10.1167/iovs.07-1329},

This process is called signal transduction.In many cases, increased amounts of these proteins have been demonstrated in cancer cells (over normal cells) and have been found to carry prognostic significance.

The algorithm, based on a special Monte Carlo procedure known as "Simulated Annealing", takes into account the probabilities for opening and closing of single base-pairs. Thus, the algorithm is able to reach structures and structure distributions near the global minimum of structure space, and is not restricted by the tendency to halt in local minima. Three types of structural folding processes may be analysed by this algorithm. Firstly, using thermodynamic data, structure ensembles comparable to those obtained by dynamic programming are achieved. Secondly, using kinetic data, the processes of structure formation and structural rearrangement may be simulated. Thirdly, additionally taking into account RNA polymerase chain elongation rates, the process of "sequential folding" during transcription may be described. Analysis of all types of structural folding and refolding is performed for RNA sequences related to potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd). The computed results are in accordance with experimental data and biological functions known for PSTVd.}},

It controls several processes in endothelial cells, such as proliferation, survival, and migration, but it is not known how these are coordinately regulated to result in more complex morphogenetic events, such as tubular sprouting, fusion, and network formation. We show here that VEGF-A controls angiogenic sprouting in the early postnatal retina by guiding filopodial extension from specialized endothelial cells situated at the tips of the vascular sprouts. The tip cells respond to VEGF-A only by guided migration; the proliferative response to VEGF-A occurs in the sprout stalks. These two cellular responses are both mediated by agonistic activity of VEGF-A on VEGF receptor 2. Whereas tip cell migration depends on a gradient of VEGF-A, proliferation is regulated by its concentration. Thus, vessel patterning during retinal angiogenesis depends on the balance between two different qualities of the extracellular VEGF-A distribution, which regulate distinct cellular responses in defined populations of endothelial cells.}},

@article{Holderfield2008Crosstalk,
    abstract = {{Abstraet-Vascular morphogenesis encompasses a temporally regulated set of morphological changes that endothelial cells
undergo to generate a network of interconnected tubules. Such a complex process inevitably involves multiple cell
signaling pathways that must be tightly coordinated in time and space. The formation of a new capillary involves
endothelial cell activation, migration, alignment, proliferation, tube formation, branching, anastomosis, and maturation
of intercellular junctions and the surrounding basement membrane. Each of these stages is either known or suspected
to fall under the influence of the vascular endothelial growth factor, notch, and transforming growth factor-f3/bone
morphogenetic protein signaling pathways. Vascular endothelial growth factor is essential for initiation of angiogenic
sprouting, and also regulates migration of capillary tip cells, proliferation of trunk cells, and gene expression in both.
Notch has been implicated in the regulation of cell fate decisions in the vasculature, especially the choice between
arterial and venular endothelial cells, and between tip and trunk cell phenotype. Transforming growth factor-f3 regulates
cell migration and proliferation, as well as matrix synthesis. In this review, we emphasize how crosstalk between these
pathways is essential for proper patterning of the vasculature and offer a transcriptional oscillator model to explain how
these pathways might interact to generate new tip cells during retinal angiogenesis.}},

explore the possibility of manipulating the extracellular matrix to achieve
pro- and anti-angiogenic effects. The model predicts specific ranges of matrix
fiber densities that maximize sprout extension speed, induce branching,
or that interrupt normal angiogenesis. We then explore matrix fiber alignment
as a key factor contributing to peak sprout velocities, and in mediating
cell shape and orientation. We also quantify the effects of proteolytic matrix
degradation by the tip cell on sprout velocity and conjecture that degradation
promotes sprout growth at high densities, but has an inhibitory effect
at lower densities. Our results are discussed in the context of ECM targeted
pro- and anti-angiogenic therapies that can be tested empirically.}},

@article{Perryn2008Vascular,
    abstract = {{Embryonic and fetal vascular sprouts form within constantly expanding tissues. Nevertheless, most biological assays of vascular spouting are conducted in a static mechanical milieu. Here we study embryonic mouse allantoides, which normally give raise to an umbilical artery and vein. However, when placed in culture, allantoides assemble a primary vascular network. Unlike other in vitro assays, allantoic primordial vascular cells are situated on the upper surface of a cellular layer that is engaged in robust spreading motion. Time-lapse imaging allows quantification of primordial vascular cell motility as well as the underlying mesothelial tissue motion. Specifically, we calculate endothelial cell-autonomous motion by subtracting the tissue-level mesothelial motion from the total endothelial cell displacements. Formation of new vascular polygons is hindered by administration of function-blocking VE-cadherin antibodies. Time-lapse recordings reveal that (1) cells at the base of sprouts normally move distally "over" existing sprout cells to form new tip-cells; and (2) loss of VE-cadherin activity prevents this motile behavior. Thus, endothelial cell-cell-adhesion-based motility is required for the advancement of vascular sprouts within a moving tissue environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that couples endogenous tissue dynamics to assembly of vascular networks in a mammalian system.}},

@article{Gabhann2006Targeting,
    abstract = {{Angiogenesis (neovascularization) plays a crucial role in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and wound healing. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical regulator of angiogenesis. Multiple VEGF receptors are expressed on endothelial cells, including signaling receptor tyrosine kinases (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) and the nonsignaling co-receptor Neuropilin-1. Neuropilin-1 binds only the isoform of VEGF responsible for pathological angiogenesis (VEGF165), and is thus a potential target for inhibiting VEGF signaling. Using the first molecularly detailed computational model of VEGF and its receptors, we have shown previously that the VEGFR–Neuropilin interactions explain the observed differential effects of VEGF isoforms on VEGF signaling in vitro, and demonstrated potent VEGF inhibition by an antibody to Neuropilin-1 that does not block ligand binding but blocks subsequent receptor coupling. In the present study, we extend that computational model to simulation of in vivo VEGF transport and binding, and predict the in vivo efficacy of several Neuropilin-targeted therapies in inhibiting VEGF signaling: (a) blocking Neuropilin-1 expression; (b) blocking VEGF binding to Neuropilin-1; (c) blocking Neuropilin–VEGFR coupling. The model predicts that blockade of Neuropilin–VEGFR coupling is significantly more effective than other approaches in decreasing VEGF–VEGFR2 signaling. In addition, tumor types with different receptor expression levels respond differently to each of these treatments. In designing human therapeutics, the mechanism of attacking the target plays a significant role in the outcome: of the strategies tested here, drugs with similar properties to the Neuropilin-1 antibody are predicted to be most effective. The tumor type and the microenvironment of the target tissue are also significant in determining therapeutic efficacy of each of the treatments studied. Neuropilin is a co-receptor for some of the isoforms of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. The presence of Neuropilin on endothelial or other cells increases binding of these isoforms to their signaling receptor VEGFR2, thus increasing pro-angiogenesis signaling and stimulating vascular growth. Neuropilin is thus a suitable target for anti-angiogenesis therapy, which holds promise for the treatment of vasculature-dependent diseases such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy. In this study, Mac Gabhann and Popel perform computational simulations of VEGF transport in breast cancer, using a previously validated model of VEGF–VEGF receptor interactions, as well as geometrical information on the tumor itself—tumor cells, vasculature, and extracellular matrix. Three different molecular therapies targeting Neuropilin are tested in silico, and the simulations predict that one of these therapies will be effective at reducing VEGFR2 signaling in certain types (or subtypes) of tumors, while the others will not. Thus, we demonstrate that identification of a target molecule is not sufficient; different therapeutic strategies targeting the same molecule may result in different outcomes.}},

This occlusive disease results in muscle ischemia, and neovascularization is a route to increasing the perfusion in the tissue. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of potent pro-angiogenic cytokines is a potential therapeutic agent, increasing VEGF-receptor signaling on tissue vasculature. To investigate the effects of possible therapies on the VEGF concentrations and gradients within the tissue, we consider three such strategies: VEGF gene therapy (e.g. by adeno-associated virus); VEGF cell-based therapy (injected myoblasts that overexpress VEGF); and chronic exercise (which upregulates VEGF receptor expression). The multi-scale computational model used to investigate these strategies is an integration of several components: an anatomical description of the muscle geometry and cell types; microvascular blood flow; tissue oxygen distribution; VEGF secretion from muscle fibers; VEGF transport through interstitial space; and VEGF-receptor binding on microvascular endothelial cells. Exercise training, which results in increased VEGF secretion in hypoxic tissue and increased VEGF receptor expression, exhibits increases in both VEGF concentration and VEGF gradients, and is predicted to be more effective than the other, VEGF-only treatments.}},

H. and J. Folkman (1977) Migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in performed and newly formed blood vessels during tumor angiogenesis, Microvasc Res., 14, 53–65; Brem, S., B. A. Preis, ScD.

Cancer Inst., 52, 413–419]. In the simplest version of this model, an avascular tumor secretes a tumor growth factor (TGF) which is transported across an extracellular matrix (ECM) to a neighboring vasculature where it stimulates endothelial cells to produce a protease that acts as a catalyst to degrade the fibronectin of the capillary wall and the ECM. The endothelial cells then move up the TGF gradient back to the tumor, proliferating and forming a new capillary network. In the model presented here, we include two mechanisms for the action of angiostatin. In the first mechanism, substantiated experimentally, the angiostatin acts as a protease inhibitor. A second mechanism for the production of protease inhibitor from angiostatin by endothelial cells is proposed to be of Michaelis-Menten type. Mathematically, this mechanism includes the former as a subcase. Our model is different from other attempts to model the process of tumor angiogenesis in that it focuses (1) on the biochemistry of the process at the level of the cell; (2) the movement of the cells is based on the theory of reinforced random walks; (3) standard transport equations for the diffusion of molecular species in porous media. One consequence of our numerical simulations is that we obtain very good computational agreement with the time of the onset of vascularization and the rate of capillary tip growth observed in rabbit cornea experiments [Ausprunk, D. H. and J. Folkman (1977) Migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in performed and newly formed blood vessels during tumor angiogenesis, Microvasc Res., 14, 73–65; Brem, S., B. A. Preis, ScD.

    abstract = {Extensive experimental studies have identified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations and concentration gradients as major factors in angiogenesis; however, localized in vivo measurements of these parameters have not been possible. We developed a three-dimensional computational model of skeletal muscle fibers, blood vessels, and interstitial space. Here it is applied to rat extensor digitorum longus. VEGF isoforms are secreted by myocytes, diffuse through extracellular matrix and basement membranes, and bind endothelial cell surface receptors on blood vessels. In addition, one isoform, VEGF164, binds to proteoglycans in the interstitial space. VEGF secretion rate is determined from the predicted tissue oxygen level through its effect on the hypoxia inducible factor-1{alpha} transcription factor. We estimate VEGF secretion and its concentrations and gradients in resting muscle and for different levels of exercise. The effects of low levels of inspired oxygen are also studied. We predict that the high spatial heterogeneity of muscle fiber VEGF secretion in hypoxic tissue leads to significant gradients of VEGF concentration and VEGF receptor activation. VEGF concentration gradients are predicted to be significant in both resting and exercising muscle (4\% and 6-8\% change in VEGF over 10 {micro}m, respectively), sufficient for chemotactic guidance of 50-{micro}m-long sprout tip cells. VEGF gradients also result in heterogeneity in VEGF receptor activation--a possible explanation for the stochasticity of sprout location. In the absence of interstitial flow, gradients are 10-fold steeper in the transverse direction (i.e., perpendicular to the muscle fibers) than in the longitudinal direction. This may explain observed perpendicular anastomoses in skeletal muscle. 10.1152/japplphysiol.00800.2006},

    abstract = {{Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins are critical regulators of angiogenesis. VEGF concentration gradients are important for activation and chemotactic guidance of capillary sprouting, but measurement of these gradients in vivo is not currently possible. We have constructed a biophysically and molecularly detailed computational model to study microenvironmental transport of two isoforms of VEGF in rat extensor digitorum longus skeletal muscle under in vivo conditions. Using parameters based on experimental measurements, the model includes: VEGF secretion from muscle fibers; binding to the extracellular matrix; binding to and activation of endothelial cell surface VEGF receptors; and internalization. For 2-D cross sections of tissue, we analyzed predicted VEGF distributions, gradients, and receptor binding. Significant VEGF gradients (up to 12\% change in VEGF concentration over 10 \^{I}¼m) were predicted in resting skeletal muscle with uniform VEGF secretion, due to non-uniform capillary distribution. These relative VEGF gradients were not sensitive to extracellular matrix composition, or to the overall VEGF expression level, but were dependent on VEGF receptor density and affinity, and internalization rate parameters. VEGF upregulation in a subset of fibers increased VEGF gradients, simulating transplantation of pro-angiogenic myoblasts, a possible therapy for ischemic diseases. The number and relative position of overexpressing fibers determined the VEGF gradients and distribution of VEGF receptor activation. With total VEGF expression level in the tissue unchanged, concentrating overexpression into a small number of adjacent fibers can increase the number of capillaries activated. The VEGF concentration gradients predicted for resting muscle (average 3\% VEGF/10 \^{I}¼m) is sufficient for cellular sensing; the tip cell of a vessel sprout is approximately 50 \^{I}¼m long. The VEGF gradients also result in heterogeneity in the activation of blood vessel VEGF receptors. This first model of VEGF tissue transport and heterogeneity provides a platform for the design and evaluation of therapeutic approaches.}},

    abstract = {{Oxygen transport from capillary networks in muscle at a high oxygen consumption rate was simulated using a computational model to assess the relative efficacies of sprouting and splitting modes of angiogenesis. Efficacy was characterized by the volumetric fraction of hypoxic tissue and overall heterogeneity of oxygen distribution at steady state. Oxygen transport was simulated for a three-dimensional vascular network using parameters for rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle when oxygen consumption by tissue reached 6, 12, and 18 times basal consumption. First, a control network was generated by using straight non-anastomosed capillaries to establish baseline capillarity. Two networks were then constructed simulating either abluminal lateral sprouting or intraluminal splitting angiogenesis such that capillary surface area was equal in both networks. The sprouting network was constructed by placing anastomosed capillaries between straight capillaries of the control network with a higher probability of placement near hypoxic tissue. The splitting network was constructed by splitting capillaries from the control network into two branches at randomly chosen branching points. Under conditions of moderate oxygen consumption (6 times basal), only minor differences in oxygen delivery resulted between the sprouting and splitting networks. At higher consumption levels (12 and 18 times basal), the splitting network had the lowest volume of hypoxic tissue of the three networks. However, when total blood flow in all three networks was made equal, the sprouting network had the lowest volume of hypoxic tissue. This study also shows that under the steady-state conditions the effect of myoglobin (Mb) on oxygen transport was small.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Vascular development and homeostasis are underpinned by two fundamental features: the generation of new vessels to meet the metabolic demands of under-perfused regions and the elimination of vessels that do not sustain flow. In this paper we develop the first multiscale model of vascular tissue growth that combines blood flow, angiogenesis, vascular remodelling and the subcellular and tissue scale dynamics of multiple cell populations. Simulations show that vessel pruning, due to low wall shear stress, is highly sensitive to the pressure drop across a vascular network, the degree of pruning increasing as the pressure drop increases. In the model, low tissue oxygen levels alter the internal dynamics of normal cells, causing them to release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates angiogenic sprouting. Consequently, the level of blood oxygenation regulates the extent of angiogenesis, with higher oxygenation leading to fewer vessels. Simulations show that network remodelling (and de novo network formation) is best achieved via an appropriate balance between pruning and angiogenesis. An important factor is the strength of endothelial tip cell chemotaxis in response to VEGF. When a cluster of tumour cells is introduced into normal tissue, as the tumour grows hypoxic regions form, producing high levels of VEGF that stimulate angiogenesis and cause the vascular density to exceed that for normal tissue. If the original vessel network is sufficiently sparse then the tumour may remain localised near its parent vessel until new vessels bridge the gap to an adjacent vessel. This can lead to metastable periods, during which the tumour burden is approximately constant, followed by periods of rapid growth.}},

This is an important factor on which both nutrient and metabolite supply depend. In this paper we aim to address this shortcoming by developing a mathematical model which shows how blood flow and red blood cell heterogeneity influence the growth of systems of normal and cancerous cells. The model is developed in two stages. First we determine the distribution of oxygen in a native vascular network, incorporating into our model features of blood flow and vascular dynamics such as structural adaptation, complex rheology and red blood cell circulation. Once we have calculated the oxygen distribution, we then study the dynamics of a colony of normal and cancerous cells, placed in such a heterogeneous environment. During this second stage, we assume that the vascular network does not evolve and is independent of the dynamics of the surrounding tissue. The cells are considered as elements of a cellular automaton, whose evolution rules are inspired by the different behaviour of normal and cancer cells. Our aim is to show that blood flow and red blood cell heterogeneity play major roles in the development of such colonies, even when the red blood cells are flowing through the vasculature of normal, healthy tissue.}},

    abstract = {{Angiogenesis, or blood vessel growth, is a critical step in the wound-healing process, involving the chemotactic response of blood vessel endothelial cells to macrophage-derived factors produced in the wound space. In this article, we formulate a system of partial differential equations that model the evolution of the capillary-tip endothelial cells, macrophage-derived chemoattractants, and the new blood vessels during the tissue repair process. Chemotaxis is incorporated as a dominant feature of the model, driving the wave-like ingrowth of the wound-healing unit. The resulting model admits traveling wave solutions that exhibit many of the features characteristic of wound healing in soft tissue. The steady propagation of the healing unit through the wound space, the development of a dense band of fine, tipped capillaries near the leading edge of the wound-healing unit (the brush-border effect), and an elevated vessel density associated with newly healed wounds, prior to vascular remodeling, are all discernible from numerical simulations of the full model. Numerical simulations mimic not only the normal progression of wound healing but also the potential for some wounds to fail to heal. Through the development and analysis of a simplified model, insight is gained into how the balance between chemotaxis, tip proliferation, and tip death affects the structure and speed of propagation of the healing unit. Further, expressions defining the healed vessel density and the wavespeed in terms of known parameters lead naturally to the identification of a maximum wavespeed for the wound-healing process and to bounds on the healed vessel density. The implications of these results for wound-healing management are also discussed.}},

In this paper a mathematical model is presented which describes the migration of capillary sprouts in response to a chemoattractant field set up by a tumour-released angiogenic factor, sometimes termed a tumour angiogenesis factor (TAF). The resulting model admits travelling wave solutions which correspond either to successful neovascularization of the tumour or failure of the tumour to secure a vascular network, and which exhibit many of the characteristic features of angiogenesis. For example, the increasing speed of the vascular front, and the evolution of an increasingly developed vascular network behind the leading capillary tip front (the brush-border effect) are both discernible from the numerical simulations. Through the development and analysis of a simplified caricature model, valuable insight is gained into how the balance between chemotaxis, tip proliferation and tip death affects the tumour's ability to induce a vascular response from neighbouring blood vessels. In particular, it is possible to define the success of angiogenesis in terms of known parameters, thereby providing a potential framework for assessing the viability of tumour neovascularization in terms of measurable quantities.}},

    abstract = {{Preclinical and clinical evidence shows that antiangiogenic agents can decrease tumor vessel permeability and interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in a process of vessel  ” normalization.” The resulting normalized vasculature has more efficient perfusion, but little is known about how tumor IFP and interstitial fluid velocity (IFV) are affected by changes in transport properties of the vessels and interstitium that are associated with antiangiogenic therapy. By using a mathematical model to simulate IFP and IFV profiles in tumors, we show here that antiangiogenic therapy can decrease IFP by decreasing the tumor size, vascular hydraulic permeability, and/or the surface area per unit tissue volume of tumor vessels. Within a certain window of antiangiogenic effects, interstitial convection within the tumor can increase dramatically, whereas fluid convection out of the tumor margin decreases. This would result in increased drug convection within the tumor and decreased convection of drugs, growth factors, or metastatic cancer cells from the tumor margin into the peritumor fluid or tissue. Decreased convection of growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), would limit peritumor hyperplasia, and decreased VEGF-A would limit angiogenesis in sentinel lymph nodes. Both of these effects would reduce the probability of lymphatic metastasis. Finally, decreased fluid convection into the peritumor tissue would decrease peritumor edema associated with brain tumors and ascites accumulation in the peritoneal or pleural cavity, a major complication with a number of malignancies.

@article{Jabbarzadeh2007Strategies,
    abstract = {{Control over angiogenesis (formation of new capillaries from preexisting vessels) is often a crucial requirement for implantable porous biomaterials serving as scaffolds for tissue regeneration. Angiogenesis is influenced by the transport of chemoattractants such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through the implant. To investigate this influence, we developed a computational model of capillary formation based on endothelial cell migration by modeling the random motion of sprout tips biased along spatially and temporally evolving concentration gradients of VEGF. The model focuses on the effect of diffusive VEGF transport inside a 2D domain on the directed migration of sprouts to test several chemical and physical strategies to stimulate and control angiogenesis. We considered a 2D porous membrane that is located between the primary vessel and a line source of VEGF. We assess the vascular network formed in 2 cases of a high and zero VEGF degradation rates applying 3 strategies of VEGF production: (1) only a line source; (2) a line source plus controlled release from a small number of VEGF sources that are randomly dispersed on the pore boundaries; and (3) a line source plus controlled release of VEGF from the pore boundaries themselves. Results show that in the limiting cases where VEGF degradation rate is relatively high, strategies 2 and 3 lead to a substantial increase in the number of vessels. This increase depends on the relative rates at which the line source and embedded sources or solid boundaries produce VEGF. Using strategy 2 results in a newly formed capillary network that is highly localized around the embedded sources. However, using strategy 3 leads to a more uniformly distributed vessel network and a higher degree of vessel ingrowth inside the porous membrane. In addition, the duration at which we engineer the embedded sources or pore boundaries to release VEGF determines the morphology of the capillary network. Although a higher release duration leads to a dense network of newly formed vessels near the primary vessel, it hinders further vessel penetration inside the porous membrane. Therefore, in applying both strategies 2 and 3, there is an optimum release duration that leads to a deeper penetration of vessels inside the membrane. It is hoped that insights from this study will aid in the design of materials with optimal structural and chemical properties to facilitate controlled angiogenesis.}},

The model represents both the avascular and the vascular phase of growth, and is able to simulate when the transition occurs; progressive formation of a necrotic core and a rim structure in the tumor during the avascular phase are also captured. In terms of transport processes, the interaction of the tumor with the surrounding tissue is realistically incorporated.

@article{Gevertz2006517,
    abstract = {{Mathematical modeling of both tumor growth and angiogenesis have been active areas of research for the past several decades. Such models can be classified into one of two categories: those that analyze the remodeling of the vasculature while ignoring changes in the tumor mass, and those that predict tumor expansion in the presence of a non-evolving vasculature. However, it is well accepted that vasculature remodeling and tumor growth strongly depend on one another. For this reason, we have developed a two-dimensional hybrid cellular automaton model of early brain tumor growth that couples the remodeling of the microvasculature with the evolution of the tumor mass. A system of reaction-diffusion equations has been developed to track the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Ang-1, Ang-2, their receptors and their complexes in space and time. The properties of the vasculature and hence of each cell are determined by the relative concentrations of these key angiogenic factors. The model exhibits an angiogenic switch consistent with experimental observations on the upregulation of angiogenesis. Particularly, we show that if the pathways that produce and respond to VEGF and the angiopoietins are properly functioning, angiogenesis is initiated and a tumor can grow to a macroscopic size. However, if the VEGF pathway is inhibited, angiogenesis does not occur and tumor growth is thwarted beyond 1-2 mm in size. Furthermore, we show that tumor expansion can occur in well-vascularized environments even when angiogenesis is inhibited, suggesting that anti-angiogenic therapies may not be sufficient to eliminate a population of actively dividing malignant cells.}},

    abstract = {{We put forward an algorithm describing the three principal interconnected sub-processes that influence tumor and vasculature dynamics: (i) tumor cell proliferation (ii) angiogenesis, that is, the formation and regression of immature vessels (IV), and (iii) maturation, i.e., the formation and destabilization of mature vessels (MV). This algorithm takes account of the crucial quantitative interactions of these sub-processes, occurring across the molecular, cellular and organ levels. Implementing this complex algorithm in a computer model, one can evaluate the correlations between various factors influencing angiogenesis and their influence on tumor progression at any given moment. Moreover, the computer simulations enable analysis of the versatile effects of drugs on the growth and decay of both the tumor and the immature and mature blood vessels, as well as on the induction of an array of relevant growth factors such as angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Simulation results suggest that vessel maturation and destabilization of MV drive the otherwise non-linearly growing system into a very dynamic region, having irregular, scale-invariant, fluctuations, around certain asymptotic values of all the involved quantities. Destabilization itself adequately explains the experimentally observed eventual decrease of tumor growth, with no need to implicate additional assumptions, such as a new tumor growth inhibitory, or anti-angiogenic, factors. Our results further suggest that mono-therapy alone can slow tumor growth, but is not capable of eliminating it altogether. In contrast, the combined treatment of anti-angiogenic and anti-maturation drugs causes prolonged suppression of tumor growth and a significant linear decrease in average tumor size. Laboratory experiments are warranted for validating our predictions and for providing in vivo evaluated parameters.}},

                In the blastocoel roof (BCR) of the Xenopus laevis embryo, epibolic movements are driven by the radial intercalation of deep cell layers and the coordinate spreading of the overlying superficial cell layer. Thinning of the lateral margins of the BCR by radial intercalation requires fibronectin (FN), which is produced and assembled into fibrils by the inner deep cell layer of the BCR. A cellular automata (CA) computer model was developed to analyze the spatial and temporal movements of BCR cells during epiboly. Simulation parameters were defined based on published data and independent results detailing initial tissue geometry, cell numbers, cell intercalation rates, and migration rates. Hypotheses regarding differential cell adhesion and FN assembly were also considered in setting system parameters. A 2-dimensional model simulation was developed that predicts BCR thinning time of 4.8 h, which closely approximates the time required for the completion of gastrulation in vivo. Additionally, the model predicts a temporal increase in FN matrix assembly that parallels fibrillogenesis in the embryo. The model is capable of independent predictions of cell rearrangements during epiboly, and here was used to predict successfully the lateral dispersion of a patch of cells implanted in the BCR, and increased assembly of FN matrix following inhibition of radial intercalation by N-cadherin over-expression.

                Remodeling of microvascular networks in mammals is critical for physiological adaptations and therapeutic revascularization. Cellular behaviors such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration are coordinated in these remodeling events via combinations of biochemical and biomechanical signals. We developed a cellular automata (CA) computational simulation that integrates epigenetic stimuli, molecular signals, and cellular behaviors to predict microvascular network patterning events. Over 50 rules obtained from published experimental data govern independent behaviors (including proliferation, differentiation, and migration) of thousands of interacting cells and diffusible growth factors in their tissue environment. From initial network patterns of in vivo blood vessel networks, the model predicts emergent patterning responses to two stimuli: 1) network-wide changes in hemodynamic mechanical stresses, and 2) exogenous focal delivery of an angiogenic growth factor. The CA model predicts comparable increases in vascular density (370+/-29 mm/mm3) 14 days after treatment with exogenous growth factor to that in vivo (480+/-41 mm/mm3) and approximately a twofold increase in contractile vessel lengths 5-10 days after 10\% increase in circumferential wall strain, consistent with in vivo results. The CA simulation was thus able to identify a functional patterning module capable of quantitatively predicting vessel network remodeling in response to two important epigenetic stimuli.

    abstract = {{Gradients of diffusible and substrate-bound molecules play an important role in guiding axons to appropriate targets in the developing nervous system. Although some of the molecules involved have recently been identified, little is known about the physical mechanisms by which growth cones sense gradients. This article applies the seminal Berg and Purcell (1977) model of gradient sensing to this problem. The model provides estimates for the statistical fluctuations in the measurement of concentration by a small sensing device. By assuming that gradient detection consists of the comparison of concentrations at two spatially or temporally separated points, the model therefore provides an estimate for the steepness of gradient that can be detected as a function of physiological parameters. The model makes the following specific predictions. (a) It is more likely that growth cones use a spatial rather than temporal sensing strategy. (b) Growth cone sensitivity increases with the concentration of ligand, the speed of ligand diffusion, the size of the growth cone, and the time over which it averages the gradient signal. (c) The minimum detectable gradient steepness for growth cones is roughly in the range 1-10\%. (d) This value varies depending on whether a bound or freely diffusing ligand is being sensed, and on whether the sensing occurs in three or two dimensions. The model also makes predictions concerning the role of filopodia in gradient detection. {\copyright} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. J Neurobiol 41: 230-241, 1999}},

    abstract = {{
                A filopodium is a cytoplasmic projection, exquisitely built and regulated, which extends from the leading edge of the migrating cell, exploring the cell's neighborhood. Commonly, filopodia grow and retract after their initiation, exhibiting rich dynamical behaviors. We model the growth of a filopodium based on a stochastic description which incorporates mechanical, physical, and biochemical components. Our model provides a full stochastic treatment of the actin monomer diffusion and polymerization of each individual actin filament under stress of the fluctuating membrane. We investigated the length distribution of individual filaments in a growing filopodium and studied how it depends on various physical parameters. The distribution of filament lengths turned out to be narrow, which we explained by the negative feedback created by the membrane load and monomeric G-actin gradient. We also discovered that filopodial growth is strongly diminished upon increasing retrograde flow, suggesting that regulating the retrograde flow rate would be a highly efficient way to control filopodial extension dynamics. The filopodial length increases as the membrane fluctuations decrease, which we attributed to the unequal loading of the membrane force among individual filaments, which, in turn, results in larger average polymerization rates. We also observed significant diffusional noise of G-actin monomers, which leads to smaller G-actin flux along the filopodial tube compared with the prediction using the diffusion equation. Overall, partial cancellation of these two fluctuation effects allows a simple mean field model to rationalize most of our simulation results. However, fast fluctuations significantly renormalize the mean field model parameters. The biological significance of our filopodial model and avenues for future development are also discussed.

Our  ” in silico reconstitution” produces qualitatively realistic bacterial motion with regard to speed and persistence of motion and actin tail morphology. The model also produces smaller scale emergent behavior; we demonstrate how the observed nano-saltatory motion of L. monocytogenes, in which runs punctuate pauses, can emerge from a cooperative binding and breaking of attachments between actin filaments and the bacterium. We describe our modeling methodology in detail, as it is likely to be useful for understanding any subcellular system in which the dynamics of many simple interactions lead to complex emergent behavior, e.g., lamellipodia and filopodia extension, cellular organization, and cytokinesis.}},

    abstract = {{Cell migration is a highly integrated process where actin turnover, actomyosin contractility, and adhesion dynamics are all closely linked. In this paper, we propose a computational model investigating the coupling of these fundamental processes within the context of spontaneous (i.e. unstimulated) cell migration. In the unstimulated cell, membrane oscillations originating from the interaction between passive hydrostatic pressure and contractility are sufficient to lead to the formation of adhesion spots. Cell contractility then leads to the maturation of these adhesion spots into focal adhesions. Due to active actin polymerization, which reinforces protrusion at the leading edge, the traction force required for cell translocation can be generated. Computational simulations first show that the model hypotheses allow one to reproduce the main features of fibroblast cell migration and established results on the biphasic aspect of the cell speed as a function of adhesion strength. The model also demonstrates that certain temporal parameters, such as the adhesion proteins recycling time and adhesion lifetimes, influence cell motion patterns, particularly cell speed and persistence of the direction of migration. This study provides some elements, which allow a better understanding of spontaneous cell migration and enables a first glance at how an individual cell would potentially react once exposed to a stimulus.}},

Unfortunately, an integrated approach to study cell–substrate interactions in a unified framework incorporating structural and chemical effects of the substrate has been lacking. In this paper, we present a new model combining experimental and computational methods to better understand the distinct behavior of E18 hippocampal neurons in response to topographical vs. immobilized chemical cues. We present results from our coarse-grain physiological computational model that correctly describes previously observed phenomena and predicts behavior that was subsequently tested through new experiments. The model differentiates topographical from chemical cues via a difference in cue spacing in these two substrates. Using the feature size spacing for topographical cues and a minimum step size, governed by the physics of filopodia protrusion, for chemical cues, the model successfully mimics the trend observed in experimental polarization probability for four different topographical feature sizes and constant chemical cue spacing. Our results not only show good agreement with experiments, but also provide novel suggestions for development of substrates for finer control of neuronal cell polarization.}},

@article{Merks2008ContactInhibited,
    abstract = {{Blood vessels form either when dispersed endothelial cells (the cells lining the inner walls of fully formed blood vessels) organize into a vessel network (vasculogenesis), or by sprouting or splitting of existing blood vessels (angiogenesis). Although they are closely related biologically, no current model explains both phenomena with a single biophysical mechanism. Most computational models describe sprouting at the level of the blood vessel, ignoring how cell behavior drives branch splitting during sprouting. We present a cell-based, Glazier–Graner–Hogeweg model (also called Cellular Potts Model) simulation of the initial patterning before the vascular cords form lumens, based on plausible behaviors of endothelial cells. The endothelial cells secrete a chemoattractant, which attracts other endothelial cells. As in the classic Keller–Segel model, chemotaxis by itself causes cells to aggregate into isolated clusters. However, including experimentally observed VE-cadherin–mediated contact inhibition of chemotaxis in the simulation causes randomly distributed cells to organize into networks and cell aggregates to sprout, reproducing aspects of both de novo and sprouting blood-vessel growth. We discuss two branching instabilities responsible for our results. Cells at the surfaces of cell clusters attempting to migrate to the centers of the clusters produce a buckling instability. In a model variant that eliminates the surface–normal force, a dissipative mechanism drives sprouting, with the secreted chemical acting both as a chemoattractant and as an inhibitor of pseudopod extension. Both mechanisms would also apply if force transmission through the extracellular matrix rather than chemical signaling mediated cell–cell interactions. The branching instabilities responsible for our results, which result from contact inhibition of chemotaxis, are both generic developmental mechanisms and interesting examples of unusual patterning instabilities. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which endothelial cells (the cells lining the inner walls of blood vessels) organize into blood vessels is crucial if we need to enhance or suppress blood vessel growth under pathological conditions, including diabetes, wound healing, and tumor growth. During embryonic development, endothelial cells initially self-organize into a network of solid cords via blood vessel growth. The vascular network expands by splitting of existing blood vessels and by sprouting. Using computer simulations, we have captured a small set of biologically plausible cell behaviors that can reproduce the initial self-organization of endothelial cells, the sprouting of existing vessels, and the immediately subsequent remodeling of the resulting networks. In this model, endothelial cells both secrete diffusible chemoattractants and move up gradients of those chemicals by extending and retracting small pseudopods. By itself, this behavior causes simulated cells to accumulate to aggregate into large, round clusters. We propose that endothelial cells stop extending pseudopods along a given section of cell membrane as soon as the membrane touches the membrane of another endothelial cell (contact inhibition). Adding such contact-inhibition to our simulations allows vascular cords to form sprouts under a wide range of conditions.}},

These in silico methods include databases, quantitative structure-activity relationships, similarity searching, pharmacophores, homology models and other molecular modeling, machine learning, data mining, network analysis tools and data analysis tools that use a computer. Such methods have seen frequent use in the discovery and optimization of novel molecules with affinity to a target, the clarification of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties as well as physicochemical characterization. The first part of this review discussed the methods that have been used for virtual ligand and target-based screening and profiling to predict biological activity. The aim of this second part of the review is to illustrate some of the varied applications of in silico methods for pharmacology in terms of the targets addressed. We will also discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of in silico methods with respect to in vitro and in vivo methods for pharmacology research. Our conclusion is that the in silico pharmacology paradigm is ongoing and presents a rich array of opportunities that will assist in expediting the discovery of new targets, and ultimately lead to compounds with predicted biological activity for these novel targets.}},

A prudent question to pose is:  ” what have we learned from these models?” This review aims to answer this question as it pertains to angiogenesis in the context of normal physiological growth, tumorigenesis, wound healing, tissue engineering, and the design of therapeutic strategies. We also provide a framework for parsing angiogenesis models into categories, according to the type of modeling approach used, the spatial and temporal scales simulated, and the overarching question being posed to the model.

@article{Hogeweg2000Evolving,
    abstract = {{
                Differential cell adhesion, mediated by e.g. integrin and cadherins/catenines, plays an important role in morphogenesis and it has been shown that there is intimate cross-talk between their expression and modification, and inter-cellular signalling, cell differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis. In this paper, we introduce and use a formal model to explore the morphogenetic potential of the interplay between these processes. We demonstrate the formation of interesting morphologies. Initiated by cell differentiation, differential cell adhesion leads to a long transient of cell migrations, e.g. engulfing and intercalation of cells and cell layers. This transient can be sustained dynamically by further cell differentiation, and by cell growth/division and cell death which are triggered by the (also long range) forces (stretching and squeezing) generated by the cell adhesion. We study the interrelation between modes of cell differentiation and modes of morphogenesis. We use an evolutionary process to zoom in on gene-regulation networks which lead to cell differentiation. Morphogenesis is not selected for but appears as a side-effect. The evolutionary dynamics shows the hallmarks of evolution on a rugged landscape, including long neutral paths. We show that a combinatorially large set of morphologies occurs in the vicinity of a neutral path which sustains cell differentiation. Thus, an almost linear molecular phylogeny gives rise to mosaic evolution on the morphological level.

@article{MacGabhann2006Computational,
    abstract = {{Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins are critical regulators of angiogenesis. VEGF concentration gradients are important for activation and chemotactic guidance of capillary sprouting, but measurement of these gradients in vivo is not currently possible. We have constructed a biophysically and molecularly detailed computational model to study microenvironmental transport of two isoforms of VEGF in rat extensor digitorum longus skeletal muscle under in vivo conditions. Using parameters based on experimental measurements, the model includes: VEGF secretion from muscle fibers; binding to the extracellular matrix; binding to and activation of endothelial cell surface VEGF receptors; and internalization. For 2-D cross sections of tissue, we analyzed predicted VEGF distributions, gradients, and receptor binding. Significant VEGF gradients (up to 12\% change in VEGF concentration over 10 μm) were predicted in resting skeletal muscle with uniform VEGF secretion, due to non-uniform capillary distribution. These relative VEGF gradients were not sensitive to extracellular matrix composition, or to the overall VEGF expression level, but were dependent on VEGF receptor density and affinity, and internalization rate parameters. VEGF upregulation in a subset of fibers increased VEGF gradients, simulating transplantation of pro-angiogenic myoblasts, a possible therapy for ischemic diseases. The number and relative position of overexpressing fibers determined the VEGF gradients and distribution of VEGF receptor activation. With total VEGF expression level in the tissue unchanged, concentrating overexpression into a small number of adjacent fibers can increase the number of capillaries activated. The VEGF concentration gradients predicted for resting muscle (average 3\% VEGF/10 μm) is sufficient for cellular sensing; the tip cell of a vessel sprout is approximately 50 μm long. The VEGF gradients also result in heterogeneity in the activation of blood vessel VEGF receptors. This first model of VEGF tissue transport and heterogeneity provides a platform for the design and evaluation of therapeutic approaches. It is not currently possible to experimentally quantify the gradients of protein concentration in the extracellular space in vivo. However, the concentration gradients of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are essential for both initiation and directed guidance of new blood vessels. The authors develop a computational model of VEGF transport in tissue in vivo (skeletal muscle, though the method is applicable to other tissues and other proteins) with realistic geometry and including biophysical interactions of VEGF, its receptors, and the extracellular matrix. Using this model, the authors predict for the first time the distribution of VEGF concentration and VEGF receptor activation throughout the tissue. VEGF concentration gradients are significant, up to 12\% change in VEGF concentration over 10 μm in resting muscle. Transplanting VEGF-overexpressing myocytes (for therapeutic induction of blood vessel growth) increases the gradients significantly. Endothelial cells in sprouting vessels are approximately 50 μm long, and therefore the predicted gradients across the cell are high and sufficient for chemotactic guidance of the new vessels. The VEGF concentration gradients also result in significant heterogeneity in the activation of VEGF receptors on blood vessels throughout the tissue, a possible reason for the sporadic nature of sprout initiation.}},

@article{Merks2006Cell,
    abstract = {{Vasculogenesis, the de novo growth of the primary vascular network from initially dispersed endothelial cells, is the first step in the development of the circulatory system in vertebrates. In the first stages of vasculogenesis, endothelial cells elongate and form a network-like structure, called the primary capillary plexus, which subsequently remodels, with the size of the vacancies between ribbons of endothelial cells coarsening over time. To isolate such intrinsic morphogenetic ability of endothelial cells from its regulation by long-range guidance cues and additional cell types, we use an in vitro model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in Matrigel. This quasi-two-dimensional endothelial cell culture model would most closely correspond to vasculogenesis in flat areas of the embryo like the yolk sac. Several studies have used continuum mathematical models to explore in vitro vasculogenesis: such models describe cell ensembles but ignore the endothelial cells' shapes and active surface fluctuations. While these models initially reproduce vascular-like morphologies, they eventually stabilize into a disconnected pattern of vascular "islands." Also, they fail to reproduce temporally correct network coarsening. Using a cell-centered computational model, we show that the endothelial cells' elongated shape is key to correct spatiotemporal in silico replication of stable vascular network growth. We validate our simulation results against HUVEC cultures using time-resolved image analysis and find that our simulations quantitatively reproduce in vitro vasculogenesis and subsequent in vitro remodeling.}},

The fractal parameters have the advantage of being scale invariant, i.e. to be independent of the magnification and resolution of the images to be investigated, making easier the comparison among different setups and experiments.RESULTS:The success of several commercial and/or free codes in computing the fractal parameters has been tested on well known exact models. Based on such a preliminary study, we selected the code Frac-lac in order to analyze images obtained by visualizing the angiogenetic process occurring in chick Chorio Allontoic Membranes (CAM), assumed to be paradigmatic of a realistic 2D vascular network. Among the parameters investigated, the fractal dimension Df proved to be the most robust estimator for CAM vascular networks. Moreover, only Df was able to discriminate between effective and elusive increases in vascularization after drug-induced angiogenic stimulations on CAMs.CONCLUSION:The fractal dimension Df is likely to be the most promising tool for monitoring the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapies in various clinical contexts.}},

    abstract = {{Context The decrease in overall death rates in the United States may mask changes in death rates from specific conditions. Objective To examine temporal trends in the age-standardized death rates and in the number of deaths from the 6 leading causes of death in the United States. Design and Setting Analyses of vital statistics data on mortality in the United States from 1970 to 2002. Main Outcome Measure The age-standardized death rate and number of deaths (coded as underlying cause) from each of the 6 leading causes of death: heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, accidents (ie, related to transportation [motor vehicle, other land vehicles, and water, air, and space] and not related to transportation [falls, fire, and accidental posioning]), and diabetes mellitus. Results The age-standardized death rate (per 100 000 per year) from all causes combined decreased from 1242 in 1970 to 845 in 2002. The largest percentage decreases were in death rates from stroke (63\%), heart disease (52\%), and accidents (41\%). The largest absolute decreases in death rates were from heart disease (262 deaths per 100 000), stroke (96 deaths per 100 000), and accidents (26 deaths per 100 000).The death rate from all types of cancer combined increased between 1970 and 1990 and then decreased through 2002, yielding a net decline of 2.7\%. In contrast, death rates doubled from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease over the entire time interval and increased by 45\% for diabetes since 1987. Despite decreases in age-standardized death rates from 4 of the 6 leading causes of death, the absolute number of deaths from these conditions continues to increase, although these deaths occur at older ages. Conclusions The absolute number of deaths and age at death continue to increase in the United States. These temporal trends have major implications for health care and health care costs in an aging population.}},

    abstract = {{
                Angiogenesis is a process of development and of growth of new capillary blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. When pathological, it contributes to the development of numerous types of tumors, and the formation of metastases. In order to grow, carcinoma need new blood vessels to form so that they can feed themselves. Therefore, nowadays the concept according to which the development of cancer is angiogenesis dependent is generally recognized. This concept makes the control of tumoral angiogenesis one of the promising therapeutic ways in cancerology. The transition from the latent phase to the invasive and metastatic phase of a cancer is linked to what is called the angiogenic switch. It implies complex cellular and molecular interactions between cancerous cells, endothelial cells and the components of the extra-cellular matrix and namely the existence of specific proteins secreted by the tumoral cells able to stimulate the proliferation of capillary endothelial cells. Among them, VEGF, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor was found in several types of tumors. It has shown a tumoral angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo, and thus is a privileged target for the control of angiogenesis in an anti-tumoral goal. The role of VEGF in tumoral angiogenesis has been extensively studied. It has been proved to undergo as well autocrine as paracrine stimulation of tumoral angiogenesis. During the last few years, several members of the VEGF family have been described namely the VEGF-A, B, C, D, E and placenta growth factor (PlGF) among which VEGF-A (121 aminoacids) plays a role of prime importance in angiogenesis. VEGF is a 45 kDA glycoprotein, homodimeric, basic, and able to bind heparin. The three-dimensional structure of VEGF has been recently determined, by X-rays diffraction, and NMR spectroscopy. The different forms of the VEGF bind to receptors that exhibit a tyrosine-kinase activity (RTK). The specific action of the VEGF on the endothelial cells is mainly regulated by two types of RTK of the VEGF family, VEGFR1, or Flt-1, and VEGFR2, or KDR/Flk-1. Mutagenesis studies have shown that only a small number of VEGF residues are important and essential for the binding with RTK. Data described to date from the studies of VEGF/RTK interactions agree to the hypothesis that KDR receptor is the main human receptor responsible for the VEGF activity in both physiological and pathological vascular development, and VEGF-KDR signalling pathway has been validated as a priority target for the development of anti- and pro- angiogenic agents. Therefore angiogenesis mediated by VEGF constitutes a new target for anti-cancer therapy which has explored through different ways of intervention aiming at the blocking of the tumoral angiogenesis. The main ones are: -Struggle against the stroma degradation and invasion by the neo-vessels -Inhibition of activated endothelial cells. -Inhibition of angiogenic factors production and of their receptors. -Inhibition of the VEGF signal pathway, by peptides blocking the bond between VEGF and its receptors through the inhibition of intracellular transduction of VEGF signal. In conclusion, this bibliographic study allows to situate works of medicinal chemistry in the context of present knowledge concerning the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its role in angiogenesis.

@article{Kafer2006Moving,
    abstract = {{Differential movement of individual cells within tissues is an important yet poorly understood process in biological development. Here we present a computational study of cell sorting caused by a combination of cell adhesion and chemotaxis, where we assume that all cells respond equally to the chemotactic signal. To capture in our model mesoscopic properties of biological cells, such as their size and deformability, we use the Cellular Potts Model, a multiscale, cell-based Monte Carlo model. We demonstrate a rich array of cell-sorting phenomena, which depend on a combination of mescoscopic cell properties and tissue level constraints. Under the conditions studied, cell sorting is a fast process, which scales linearly with tissue size. We demonstrate the occurrence of  ” absolute negative mobility”, which means that cells may move in the direction opposite to the applied force (here chemotaxis). Moreover, during the sorting, cells may even reverse the direction of motion. Another interesting phenomenon is  ” minority sorting”, where the direction of movement does not depend on cell type, but on the frequency of the cell type in the tissue. A special case is the cAMP-wave-driven chemotaxis of Dictyostelium cells, which generates pressure waves that guide the sorting. The mechanisms we describe can easily be overlooked in studies of differential cell movement, hence certain experimental observations may be misinterpreted.}},

Equal error metric ambiguity can permit algorithimic selection of raster points for a line from (X0, Y0) to (X1, Y1) to differ from points selected rastering the same line back from (X1, Y1) to (X0, Y0). Modilying a rastering algorithm to provide an exactly reversibie path, though, will cause problems when lines are rastered in a context of approximating a circle with a polygon. Only by fully understanding any algorithm can designers determine whether such pel-level anomalies are worth the code space or circuit count necessary to provide explicit user resolution, or whether a fixed default must suffice. This article discusses implementation considerations relevant to selecting and customizing incremental line-drawing algorithms to cope with such anomalies as equal error metric instances, perturbation effects of clipping, interesections in raster space, EXOR interpretations for polylines, reversibility, and fractional endpoint rounding.}},

@article{Eldar2003SelfEnhanced,
    abstract = {{Morphogen gradients provide long-range positional information by extending across a developing field. To ensure reproducible patterning, their profile is invariable despite genetic or environmental fluctuations. Common models assume a morphogen profile that decays exponentially. Here, we show that exponential profiles cannot, at the same time, buffer fluctuations in morphogen production rate and define long-range gradients. To comply with both requirements, morphogens should decay rapidly close to their source but at a significantly slower rate over most of the field. Numerical search revealed two network designs that support robustness to fluctuations in morphogen production rate. In both cases, morphogens enhance their own degradation, leading to a higher degradation rate close to their source. This is achieved through reciprocal interactions between the morphogen and its receptor. The two robust networks are consistent with properties of the Wg and Hh morphogens in the  Drosophila  wing disc and provide novel insights into their function.}},

@article{Eldar2002Robustness,
    abstract = {{Developmental patterning relies on morphogen gradients, which generally involve feedback loops to buffer against perturbations caused by fluctuations in gene dosage and expression. Although many gene components involved in such feedback loops have been identified, how they work together to generate a robust pattern remains unclear. Here we study the network of extracellular proteins that patterns the dorsal region of the Drosophila embryo by establishing a graded activation of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway. We find that the BMP activation gradient itself is robust to changes in gene dosage. Computational search for networks that support robustness shows that transport of the BMP class ligands (Scw and Dpp) into the dorsal midline by the BMP inhibitor Sog is the key event in this patterning process. The mechanism underlying robustness relies on the ability to store an excess of signalling molecules in a restricted spatial domain where Sog is largely absent. It requires extensive diffusion of the BMP-Sog complexes, coupled with restricted diffusion of the free ligands. We show experimentally that Dpp is widely diffusible in the presence of Sog but tightly localized in its absence, thus validating a central prediction of our theoretical study.}},

@article{Lai2004Sonic,
    abstract = {{Sonic hedgehog (Shh) controls critical cellular decisions between distinct fates in many systems, particularly in stem cells. The Shh network functions as a genetic switch, and we have theoretically and computationally analyzed how its structure can endow it with the ability to switch fate choices at a threshold Shh concentration. The network is composed of a positive transcriptional feedback loop embedded within a negative signaling feedback loop. Specifically, positive feedback by the transcription factor Gli, which upregulates its own expression, leads to a switch that can adopt two distinct states as a function of Shh. However, Gli also upregulates the signaling repressor Patched, negative feedback that reins in the strong Gli autoregulatory loop. Mutations that have been associated with cancer are predicted to yield an irreversible switch to a high Gli state. Finally, stochastic simulation reveals the negative Patched feedback loop serves a critical function of dampening Gli fluctuations to reduce spontaneous state switching and preserve the network's robust, switch-like behavior. Tightly linked positive and negative feedback loops are present in many signaling systems, and the Shh system is therefore likely representative of a large set of gene regulation networks that control stem cell fate throughout development and into adulthood.}},

@article{Saha2006Signal,
    abstract = {{During development, secreted signaling factors, called morphogens, instruct cells to adopt specific mature phenotypes. However, the mechanisms that morphogen systems employ to establish a precise concentration gradient for patterning tissue architecture are highly complex and are typically analyzed only at long times after secretion (i.e. steady state). We have developed a theoretical model that analyzes dynamically how the intricate transport and signal transduction mechanisms of a model morphogen, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), cooperate in modular fashion to regulate tissue patterning in the neural tube. Consistent with numerous recent studies, the model elucidates how the dynamics of gradient formation can be a key determinant of cell response. In addition, this work yields several novel insights into how different transport mechanisms or `modules' control pattern formation. The model predicts that slowing the transport of a morphogen, such as by lipid modification of the ligand Shh, by ligand binding to proteoglycans, or by the moderate upregulation of dedicated transport molecules like Dispatched, can actually increase the signaling range of the morphogen by concentrating it near the secretion source. Furthermore, several transcriptional targets of Shh, such as Patched and Hedgehog-interacting protein, significantly limit its signaling range by slowing transport and promoting ligand degradation. This modeling approach elucidates how individual modular elements that operate dynamically at various times during patterning can shape a tissue pattern. 10.1242/dev.02254}},

We discuss methods for designing and constructing engineered cells with novel functions in a framework of an abstract hierarchy of biological devices, modules, cells, and multicellular systems. The classical engineering strategies of standardization, decoupling, and abstraction will have to be extended to take into account the inherent characteristics of biological devices and modules. To achieve predictability and reliability, strategies for engineering biology must include the notion of cellular context in the functional definition of devices and modules, use rational redesign and directed evolution for system optimization, and focus on accomplishing tasks using cell populations rather than individual cells. The discussion brings to light issues at the heart of designing complex living systems and provides a trajectory for future development.

@article{McDougall2002Mathematical,
    abstract = {{Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature, is a process whereby capillary sprouts are formed in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial cell migration, and organize themselves into a branched, connected network structure. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout-tip permits further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumours. In this paper we initially generate theoretical capillary networks (which are morphologically similar to those networks observed in vivo) using the discrete mathematical model of Anderson and Chaplain. This discrete model describes the formation of a capillary sprout network via endothelial cell migratory and proliferative responses to external chemical stimuli (tumour angiogenic factors, TAF) supplied by a nearby solid tumour, and also the endothelial cell interactions with the extracellular matrix. The main aim of this paper is to extend this work to examine fluid flow through these theoretical network structures. In order to achieve this we make use of flow modelling tools and techniques (specifically, flow through interconnected networks) from the field of petroleum engineering. Having modelled the flow of a basic fluid through our network, we then examine the effects of fluid viscosity, blood vessel size (i.e., diameter of the capillaries), and network structure/geometry, upon: (i) the rate of flow through the network; (ii) the amount of fluid present in the complete network at any one time; and (iii) the amount of fluid reaching the tumour. The incorporation of fluid flow through the generated vascular networks has highlighted issues that may have major implications for the study of nutrient supply to the tumour (blood/oxygen supply) and, more importantly, for the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to the tumour. Indeed, there are also implications for the delivery of anti-angiogenesis drugs to the network itself. Results clearly highlight the important roles played by the structure and morphology of the network, which is, in turn, linked to the size and geometry of the nearby tumour. The connectedness of the network, as measured by the number of loops formed in the network (the anastomosis density), is also found to be of primary significance. Moreover, under certain conditions, the results of our flow simulations show that an injected chemotherapy drug may bypass the tumour altogether.}},

Although molecular biology, histopathology, and radiological imaging are employed in this endeavor, studies are severely challenged by the multitude of different physical scales involved in tumor growth, i.e., from molecular nanoscale to cell microscale and finally to tissue centimeter scale. Consequently, it is often difficult to determine the underlying dynamics across dimensions. New techniques are needed to tackle these issues. Here, we address this multi-scalar problem by employing a novel predictive three-dimensional mathematical and computational model based on first-principle equations (conservation laws of physics) that describe mathematically the diffusion of cell substrates and other processes determining tumor mass growth and invasion. The model uses conserved variables to represent known determinants of glioma behavior, e.g., cell density and oxygen concentration, as well as biological functional relationships and parameters linking phenomena at different scales whose specific forms and values are hypothesized and calculated based on in vitro and in vivo experiments and from histopathology of tissue specimens from human gliomas. This model enables correlation of glioma morphology to tumor growth by quantifying interdependence of tumor mass on the microenvironment (e.g., hypoxia, tissue disruption) and on the cellular phenotypes (e.g., mitosis and apoptosis rates, cell adhesion strength). Once functional relationships between variables and associated parameter values have been informed, e.g., from histopathology or intra-operative analysis, this model can be used for disease diagnosis/prognosis, hypothesis testing, and to guide surgery and therapy. In particular, this tool identifies and quantifies the effects of vascularization and other cell-scale glioma morphological characteristics as predictors of tumor-scale growth and invasion.

    abstract = {{Angiogenesis, the growth of a network of blood vessels, is a crucial component of solid tumour growth, linking the relatively harmless avascular growth phase and the potentially fatal vascular growth phase. As a process, angiogenesis is a well-orchestrated sequence of events involving endothelial cell migration, proliferation; degradation of tissue; new capillary vessel (sprout) formation; loop formation (anastomosis) and, crucially, blood flow through the network. Once there is blood flow associated with the nascent network, the subsequent growth of the network evolves both temporally and spatially in response to the combined effects of angiogenic factors, migratory cues via the extracellular matrix and perfusion-related haemodynamic forces in a manner that may be described as both adaptive and dynamic. In this paper we present a mathematical model which simultaneously couples vessel growth with blood flow through the vessels—dynamic adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis (DATIA). This new mathematical model presents a theoretical and computational investigation of the process and highlights a number of important new targets for therapeutic intervention. In contrast to earlier flow models, where the effects of perfusion (blood flow) were essentially evaluated a posteriori, i.e. after generating a hollow network, blood flow in the model described in this paper has a direct impact during capillary growth, with radial adaptations and network remodelling occurring as immediate consequences of primary anastomoses. Capillary network architectures resulting from the dynamically adaptive model are found to differ radically from those obtained using earlier models. The DATIA model is used to examine the effects of changing various physical and biological model parameters on the developing vascular architecture and the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to the tumour. Subsequent simulations of chemotherapeutic treatments under different parameter regimes lead to the identification of a number of new therapeutic targets for tumour management.}},

                The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) has been used in a wide variety of biological simulations. However, most current CPM implementations use a sequential modified Metropolis algorithm which restricts the size of simulations. In this paper we present a parallel CPM algorithm for simulations of morphogenesis, which includes cell-cell adhesion, a cell volume constraint, and cell haptotaxis. The algorithm uses appropriate data structures and checkerboard subgrids for parallelization. Communication and updating algorithms synchronize properties of cells simulated on different processor nodes. Tests show that the parallel algorithm has good scalability, permitting large-scale simulations of cell morphogenesis (10(7) or more cells) and broadening the scope of CPM applications. The new algorithm satisfies the balance condition, which is sufficient for convergence of the underlying Markov chain.

The growth rate of the tumour decreases at the onset of shell formation in agreement with experimental observation. The tumour eventually approaches a steady state, where the increase in volume due to the growth of the proliferating cells equals the loss of volume due to the disintegration of cells in the necrotic core.

In this way we investigate the influence of changes in cell-cell adhesion on the invasion process. We demonstrate that the morphology of the invading front is influenced by changes in the adhesiveness parameters, and detail how the invasiveness of the tumour is related to adhesion. We show that cell-cell adhesion has less of an influence on invasion compared with cell-medium adhesion, and that increases in both proteolytic enzyme secretion rate and the coefficient of haptotaxis act in synergy to promote invasion. We extend the simulation by including proliferation, and, following experimental evidence, develop an algorithm for cell division in which the mitotic rate is explicitly related to changes in the relative magnitudes of homotypic and heterotypic adhesiveness. We show that although an increased proliferation rate usually results in an increased depth of invasion into the extracellular matrix, it does not invariably do so, and may, indeed, cause invasiveness to be reduced.}},

At the cellular level, the model uses the cellular Potts model based on system-energy reduction to describe endothelial cell migration, growth, division, cellular adhesion, and the evolving structure of the stroma. Numerical simulations show: 1), different tumor-secreted pro-angiogenic factor gradient profiles dramatically affect capillary sprout morphology; 2), average sprout extension speeds depend on the proximity of the proliferating region to the sprout tip, and the coordination of cellular functions; and 3), inhomogeneities in the extravascular tissue lead to sprout branching and anastomosis, phenomena that emerge without any prescribed rules. This model provides a quantitative framework to test hypotheses on the biochemical and biomechanical mechanisms that control tumor-induced angiogenesis.

    abstract = {{Tumor growth is angiogenesis dependent. As a consequence, strategies aimed at disrupting this mechanism are heavily investigated. Several angiogenesis assays are used to directly compare the efficacy of anti-angiogenic compounds. However, objective assessment of new vascular growth has been difficult to achieve. The aim of this study was to test and develop a computer-assisted image analysis method that would give an unbiased quantification of the microvessel density. Human tumors were grown in athymic mice and tumor biopsies were taken after a weeklong treatment with VEGF–toxin conjugate. Frozen tumor sections were prepared and stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD-31 antibodies and vessels were imaged with a fluorescence microscope. Vessel density was analyzed by quantifying PE-positive pixels per recorded field. In addition, images were further processed to investigate morphological differences by an automated binarization and skeletonization protocol. This procedure allowed the computer-assisted estimation of important angiogenic parameters such as total vessel number, length, and branch points. Based on these indices, differences in the angiogenic response between control tumors and those treated with VEGF–toxin conjugate were readily detected (P < 0.007 for all parameters). More importantly, computer-generated measurements correlated well with manual microvessel counts and showed significantly less variation. Our results suggest that computer-assisted image analysis represents a rapid, objective, and alternative method for the quantitative assessment of tumor angiogenesis and vessel architecture. }},

    abstract = {{Motivation: CompuCell is a multi-model software framework for simulation of the development of multicellular organisms known as morphogenesis. It models the interaction of the gene regulatory network with generic cellular mechanisms, such as cell adhesion, division, haptotaxis and chemotaxis. A combination of a state automaton with stochastic local rules and a set of differential equations, including subcellular ordinary differential equations and extracellular reaction–diffusion partial differential equations, model gene regulation. This automaton in turn controls the differentiation of the cells, and cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions that give rise to cell rearrangements and pattern formation, e.g. mesenchymal condensation. The cellular Potts model, a stochastic model that accurately reproduces cell movement and rearrangement, models cell dynamics. All these models couple in a controllable way, resulting in a powerful and flexible computational environment for morphogenesis, which allows for simultaneous incorporation of growth and spatial patterning.}},

Ideally, models used to search for the simplest developmental principles on how genes produce form should account for both developmental process and evolutionary change. Here we present a model reproducing the morphology of mammalian teeth by integrating experimental data on gene interactions and growth into a morphodynamic mechanism in which developing morphology has a causal role in patterning. The model predicts the course of tooth-shape development in different mammalian species and also reproduces key transitions in evolution. Furthermore, we reproduce the known expression patterns of several genes involved in tooth development and their dynamics over developmental time. Large morphological effects frequently can be achieved by small changes, according to this model, and similar morphologies can be produced by different changes. This finding may be consistent with why predicting the morphological outcomes of molecular experiments is challenging. Nevertheless, models incorporating morphology and gene activity show promise for linking genotypes to phenotypes.}},

    abstract = {{We present a classification of developmental mechanisms that have been shown experimentally to generate pattern and form in metazoan organisms. We propose that all such mechanisms can be organized into three basic categories and that two of these may act as composite mechanisms in two different ways. The simple categories are cell autonomous mechanisms in which cells enter into specific arrangements (`patterns') without interacting, inductive mechanisms in which cell communication leads to changes in pattern by reciprocal or hierarchical alteration of cell phenotypes (`states') and morphogenetic mechanisms in which pattern changes by means of cell interactions that do not change cell states. The latter two types of mechanism can be combined either morphostatically, in which case inductive mechanisms act first, followed by the morphogenetic mechanism, or morphodynamically, in which case both types of mechanisms interact continuously to modify each other's dynamics. We propose that this previously unexplored distinction in the operation of composite developmental mechanisms provides insight into the dynamics of many developmental processes. In particular, morphostatic and morphodynamic mechanisms respond to small changes in their genetic and microenvironmental components in dramatically different ways. We suggest that these differences in `variational properties' lead to morphostatic and morphodynamic mechanisms being represented to different extents in early and late stages of development and to their contributing in distinct ways to morphological transitions in evolution.}},
