@article{qanitabaker:Klingberg2013Myofibroblast,
    abstract = {{Myofibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in which they reside, are critical components of wound healing and fibrosis. The ECM, traditionally viewed as the structural elements within which cells reside, is actually a functional tissue whose components possess not only scaffolding characteristics, but also growth factor, mitogenic, and other bioactive properties. Although it has been suggested that tissue fibrosis simply reflects an 'exuberant' wound-healing response, examination of the ECM and the roles of myofibroblasts during fibrogenesis instead suggest that the organism may be attempting to recapitulate developmental programmes designed to regenerate functional tissue. Evidence of this is provided by the temporospatial re-emergence of embryonic ECM proteins by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts that induce cellular programmatic responses intended to produce a functional tissue. In the setting of wound healing (or physiological fibrosis), this occurs in a highly regulated and exquisitely choreographed fashion which results in cessation of haemorrhage, restoration of barrier integrity, and re-establishment of tissue function. However, pathological tissue fibrosis, which oftentimes causes organ dysfunction and significant morbidity or mortality, likely results from dysregulation of normal wound-healing processes or abnormalities of the process itself. This review will focus on the myofibroblast ECM and its role in both physiological and pathological fibrosis, and will discuss the potential for therapeutically targeting ECM proteins for treatment of fibrotic disorders.

Fibrotic diseases, which include pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, liver cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease, account for over 45\% of deaths in the developed world. ECM remodeling is also crucial for tumor malignancy and metastatic progression, which ultimately cause over 90\% of deaths from cancer. Here, we discuss current methodologies and models for understanding and quantifying the impact of environmental cues provided by the ECM on disease progression, and how improving our understanding of ECM remodeling in these pathological conditions is crucial for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. This can only be achieved through the use of appropriate in vitro and in vivo models to mimic disease, and with technologies that enable accurate monitoring, imaging and quantification of the ECM.}},

We also discuss efficient algorithms for encoding the model, and give an example of a simulation of an epithelial sheet.

This paper presents an overview of the rapidly expanding, nascent field of research that deals with the biomechanics and biophysics of cancer cells. The review begins with some key observations on the biology of cancer cells and on the role of actin microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubule biopolymer cytoskeletal components in influencing cell mechanics, locomotion, differentiation and neoplastic transformation. In order to set the scene for mechanistic discussions of the connections among alterations to subcellular structures, attendant changes in cell deformability, cytoadherence, migration, invasion and tumor metastasis, a survey is presented of the various quantitative mechanical and physical assays to extract the elastic and viscoelastic deformability of cancer cells. Results available in the literature on cell mechanics for different types of cancer are then reviewed. Representative case studies are presented next to illustrate how chemically induced cytoskeletal changes, biomechanical responses and signals from the intracellular regions act in concert with the chemomechanical environment of the extracellular matrix and the molecular tumorigenic signaling pathways to effect malignant transformations. Results are presented to illustrate how changes to cytoskeletal architecture induced by cancer drugs and chemotherapy regimens can significantly influence cell mechanics and disease state. It is reasoned through experimental evidence that greater understanding of the mechanics of cancer cell deformability and its interactions with the extracellular physical, chemical and biological environments offers enormous potential for significant new developments in disease diagnostics, prophylactics, therapeutics and drug efficacy assays.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Yu2004Transforming,
    abstract = {{We have shown recently that the hyaluronan receptor, CD44, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) form a complex on the surface of TA/St mouse mammary carcinoma cells that activates latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and is required for tumor invasion. Disruption of the CD44/MMP-9 complex by expression of soluble CD44 results in the loss of tumor invasiveness and abrogates tumor cell survival in host lung parenchyma following intravenous injection into syngeneic mice. To explore the molecular nature of the survival signals derived from the CD44/MMP-9 complex during the development of tumor metastasis, we investigated the possibility that activation of latent TGF-beta by the CD44/MMP-9 complex is responsible for tumor cell survival in host lung parenchyma. TA3 cells overexpressing dominant negative soluble CD44 (TA3sCD44), which compromises native CD44 function and the ability of TA3 cells to develop metastases, were transfected with constitutively active or latent TGF-beta2 and tested for their ability to form tumors in syngeneic mice. Our results demonstrate that expression of the constitutively active, but not the latent, form of TGF-beta2 rescues TA3sCD44 cells from apoptosis during lung colonization. These observations provide evidence that activation of latent TGF-beta constitutes an event downstream of CD44-dependent signals that is required for tumor cell survival and metastatic colony formation. The functional axis composed of CD44, MMP-9 and TGF-beta may therefore play an important role in the metastatic proclivity of selected tumor types.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Patani2010Prognostic,
    abstract = {{Ubiquitin modification of proteins influences cellular processes relevant to carcinogenesis. CHIP (carboxyl-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) is a chaperone-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulating the stability of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) interacting proteins. CHIP is implicated in the modulation of estrogen receptor (ESR1) and Her-2/neu (ERBB2) stability. LOX (lysyl-oxidase) serves intracellular roles and catalyses the cross-linking of extracellular matrix (ECM) collagens and elastin. LOX expression is altered in human malignancies and their peri-tumoral stroma. However, paradoxical roles are reported. In this study, the level of mRNA expression of CHIP and LOX were assessed in normal and malignant breast tissue and correlated with clinico-pathological parameters.
                Breast cancer (BC) tissues (n = 127) and normal tissues (n = 33) underwent RNA extraction and reverse transcription; transcript levels were determined using real-time quantitative PCR and normalized against CK-19. Transcript levels were analyzed against TNM stage, nodal involvement, tumor grade and clinical outcome over a ten-year follow-up period.
                CHIP EXPRESSION DECREASED WITH INCREASING NOTTINGHAM PROGNOSTIC INDEX (NPI): NPI-1 vs. NPI-3 (12.2 vs. 0.2, P = 0.0264), NPI-2 vs. NPI-3 (3 vs. 0.2, P = 0.0275). CHIP expression decreased with increasing TNM stage: TNM-1 vs. TNM-2 (12 vs. 0, P = 0.0639), TNM-1 vs. TNM-2-4 (12 vs. 0, P = 0.0434). Lower transcript levels were associated with increasing tumor grade: grade 1 vs. grade 3 (17.7 vs. 0.3, P = 0.0266), grade 2 vs. grade 3 (5 vs. 0.3, P = 0.0454). The overall survival (OS) for tumors classified as 'low-level expression', was poorer than those with 'high-level expression' (118.1 vs. 152.3 months, P = 0.039). LOX expression decreased with increasing NPI: NPI-1 vs. NPI-2 (3 vs. 0, P = 0.0301) and TNM stage: TNM-1 = 3854639, TNM-2 = 908900, TNM-3 = 329, TNM-4 = 1.232 (P = NS).
                CHIP expression is associated with favorable prognostic parameters, including tumor grade, TNM stage and NPI. CHIP expression predicts OS. LOX expression is associated with improved NPI. In addition to their prognostic utility, mechanistic insights into tumor suppressor function may offer potential therapeutic strategies.}},

Lysyl oxidase (LOX), which is an ECM remodeling enzyme, appears to play roles in promoting cancer cell motility and invasion. To ascertain whether LOX overexpression in breast tumor tissues from Asian patients is associated with decreases in metastasis-free and overall survival in breast cancer patients, the mRNA levels of LOX were examined in paired tumor/normal tissue samples using real-time RT-PCR analysis (n = 246 pair-matched samples). To test whether specifically targeting LOX by inhibiting its activity (using beta-aminopropionitrile (β-APN), a LOX inhibitor), mRNA expression (using siRNA), or protein expression (using 25 μM magnolol) attenuates the invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, a cancer cell migration assay was performed. Interestingly, only 78.5\% (n = 193) of the breast cancer tumors displayed detectable LOX expression. Nearly 60\% (n = 120) of the cases fell into Group 1 (tumor > normal, T > N); in this group, the mean LOX expression in the tumor cells was 20.2-fold greater than in normal cells. However, in Group 2 (normal > tumor, N > T), the LOX expression level in most of the normal tissues examined (80\%, 59/73) was less than fivefold greater than in the tumor tissues. The increased level of active LOX in the invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was accompanied by the increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at Tyr-576 and of paxillin at Tyr-118. We also found that the addition of β-APN (300 μM) and magnolol (25 μM), synergistically inhibited the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. In this article, we describe, for the first time, higher expression of a LOX protein in breast tumors compared with normal tissues from Asian patients. Moreover, the results indicate that the inhibition of LOX using magnolol may represent a more desirable strategy for breast cancer therapy than the use of β-APN.}},

                LOX-RNAi-LV was designed, synthesized, and then transfected into a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). Expression of LOX, MMP-2 and MMP-9 was determined by real-time PCR, and protein expression of LOX by Western blotting. Cell migration and invasiveness were assessed with Transwell chambers. A total of 111 cases of breast cancer tissues, cancer-adjacent normal breast tissues, and 20 cases of benign lesion tissues were assessed by immunohistochemistry.
                Expression of LOX mRNA and protein was suppressed, and the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly lower in the RNAi group than the control group (P<0.05), after LOX-RNAi-LV was transfection into MDA-MB-231 cells. Migration and invasion abilities were obviously inhibited. The expression of LOX protein in breast cancer, cancer-adjacent normal breast tissues and benign breast tumor were 48.6\% (54/111), 26.1\% (29/111), 20.0\% (4/20), respectively, associations being noted with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor size and ER, PR, HER2, but not age. LOX protein was positively correlated with MMP-2 and MMP-9.

We introduce a model of mechanical cell-BM-ECM interactions that extends current (visco)elastic models (e.g. [8,16]), and connects to recent agent-based cell models (e.g. [2,3,20,26]). We model the BM as a linked series of Hookean springs, each with time-varying length, thickness, and spring constant. Each BM spring node exchanges adhesive and repulsive forces with the cell agents using potential functions. We model elastic BM-ECM interactions with analogous ECM springs. We introduce a new model of plastic BM and ECM reorganization in response to prolonged strains, and new constitutive relations that incorporate molecular-scale effects of plasticity into the spring constants. We find that varying the balance of BM and ECM elasticity alters the node spacing along cell boundaries, yielding a nonuniform BM thickness. Uneven node spacing generates stresses that are relieved by plasticity over long times. We find that elasto-viscoplastic cell shape response is critical to relieving uneven stresses in the BM. Our modeling advances and results highlight the importance of rigorously modeling of cell-BM-ECM interactions in clinically important conditions with significant membrane deformations and time-varying membrane properties, such as aneurysms and progression from in situ to invasive carcinoma.}},

We introduce a model of mechanical cell-BM-ECM interactions that extends current (visco)elastic models (e.g. [8,16]), and connects to recent agent-based cell models (e.g. [2,3,20,26]). We model the BM as a linked series of Hookean springs, each with time-varying length, thickness, and spring constant. Each BM spring node exchanges adhesive and repulsive forces with the cell agents using potential functions. We model elastic BM-ECM interactions with analogous ECM springs. We introduce a new model of plastic BM and ECM reorganization in response to prolonged strains, and new constitutive relations that incorporate molecular-scale effects of plasticity into the spring constants. We find that varying the balance of BM and ECM elasticity alters the node spacing along cell boundaries, yielding a nonuniform BM thickness. Uneven node spacing generates stresses that are relieved by plasticity over long times. We find that elasto-viscoplastic cell shape response is critical to relieving uneven stresses in the BM. Our modeling advances and results highlight the importance of rigorously modeling of cell-BM-ECM interactions in clinically important conditions with significant membrane deformations and time-varying membrane properties, such as aneurysms and progression from in situ to invasive carcinoma.}},

    abstract = {{Many advances in research regarding immuno-interactions with cancer were developed with the help of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. These models, however, are not effectively capable of representing problems involving individual localisation, memory and emerging properties, which are common characteristics of cells and molecules of the immune system. Agent-based modelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that overcomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when compared to ODE modelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it possible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do the outcomes differ? Are there any benefits of using one method compared to the other? To answer these questions, we have considered three case studies using established mathematical models of immune interactions with early-stage cancer. These case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and the simulation results were then compared with those from the ODE models. Our results show that it is possible to obtain equivalent agent-based models (i.e. implementing the same mechanisms); the simulation output of both types of models however might differ depending on the attributes of the system to be modelled. In some cases, additional insight from using agent-based modelling was obtained. Overall, we can confirm that agent-based modelling is a useful addition to the tool set of immunologists, as it has extra features that allow for simulations with characteristics that are closer to the biological phenomena.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Powathil2012Modelling,
    abstract = {{The therapeutic control of a solid tumour depends critically on the responses of the individual cells that constitute the entire tumour mass. A particular cell's spatial location within the tumour and intracellular interactions, including the evolution of the cell-cycle within each cell, has an impact on their decision to grow and divide. They are also influenced by external signals from other cells as well as oxygen and nutrient concentrations. Hence, it is important to take these into account when modelling tumour growth and the response to various treatment regimes ('cell-kill therapies'), including chemotherapy. In order to address this multiscale nature of solid tumour growth and its response to treatment, we propose a hybrid, individual-based approach that analyses spatio-temporal dynamics at the level of cells, linking individual cell behaviour with the macroscopic behaviour of cell organisation and the microenvironment. The individual tumour cells are modelled by using a cellular automaton (CA) approach, where each cell has its own internal cell-cycle, modelled using a system of ODEs. The internal cell-cycle dynamics determine the growth strategy in the CA model, making it more predictive and biologically relevant. It also helps to classify the cells according to their cell-cycle states and to analyse the effect of various cell-cycle dependent cytotoxic drugs. Moreover, we have incorporated the evolution of oxygen dynamics within this hybrid model in order to study the effects of the microenvironment in cell-cycle regulation and tumour treatments. An important factor from the treatment point of view is that the low concentration of oxygen can result in a hypoxia-induced quiescence (G0/G1 arrest) of the cancer cells, making them resistant to key cytotoxic drugs. Using this multiscale model, we investigate the impact of oxygen heterogeneity on the spatio-temporal patterning of the cell distribution and their cell-cycle status. We demonstrate that oxygen transport limitations result in significant heterogeneity in HIF-1 α signalling and cell-cycle status, and when these are combined with drug transport limitations, the efficacy of the therapy is significantly impaired.

@article{qanitabaker:Adam2011Increased,
    abstract = {{The aim of the study is to characterize the signal transduction leading to interstitial fibrosis in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial remodeling. Samples of the left atrial appendage (LA) from patients with AF showed higher collagen content (73 ± 5 vs. 38 ± 2 μg/mg protein) and 2.5-fold increased collagen crosslinking compared to patients with sinus rhythm (SR). Affymetrix-assays, RT-PCR and western Blot analysis revealed that LA of AF patients are characterized by increased lysyl oxidase (LOX) mRNA (218 ± 42\%) and protein (253 ± 11\%) expression. This was associated with increased expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin and Rac1 activity compared to SR. In neonatal cardiac fibroblasts, the Rac1 specific small molecule inhibitor NSC23766 prevented angiotensin II (AngII) induced upregulation of LOX (214 ± 16\%) expression. Inhibition of CTGF by siRNA transfections completely inhibited AngII induced LOX expression. The LOX specific small molecule inhibitor BAPN prevented AngII and CTGF induced fibronectin expression. Left atria of transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of Rac1 (RacET) that develop AF at high age exhibited upregulation of CTGF as well as LOX (187 ± 7\%) and fibronectin (627 ± 146\%) expression. Atria of RacET showed increased collagen content (28 ± 2 μg/mg protein) and crosslinking (10 ± 0.7) compared to wildtypes (20 ± 0.4 μg/mg protein; 5 ± 0.9). Left atrial myocardium of patients with atrial fibrillation is characterized by increased lysyl oxidase and fibronectin expression as well as collagen cross-linking. In cardiac fibroblasts, Rac1 GTPase mediates upregulation of fibronectin via LOX and CTGF. Inhibition of this signaling pathway may therefore represent a target for the prevention of fibrotic atrial remodeling.

    abstract = {{Individual-based modelling of biofilms accounts for the fact that individual organisms of the same species may well be in a different physiological state as a result of environmental gradients, lag times in responding to change, or noise in gene expression, which we have become increasingly aware of with the advent of single-cell microbiology. But progress in developing and using individual-based modelling has been hampered by different groups writing their own code and the lack of an available standard model. We therefore set out to merge most features of previous models and incorporate various improvements in order to provide a common basis for further developments. Four improvements stand out: the biofilm pressure field allows for shrinking or consolidating biofilms; the continuous-in-time extracellular polymeric substances excretion leads to more realistic fluid behaviour of the extracellular matrix, avoiding artefacts; the stochastic chemostat mode allows comparison of spatially uniform and heterogeneous systems; and the separation of growth kinetics from the individual cell allows condition-dependent switching of metabolism. As an illustration of the model's use, we used the latter feature to study how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of denitrifying bacteria that induce the denitrification pathway under anoxic or low oxygen conditions. We tested the hypothesis that the existence of these diverse strategies of denitrification can be explained solely by assuming that faster response incurs higher costs. We found that if the ability to switch metabolic pathways quickly incurs no costs the fastest responder is always the best. However, if there is a trade-off where faster switching incurs higher costs, then there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations, suggesting that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different environments. In a single environment, biodiversity of denitrifiers is higher in biofilms than chemostats, higher with than without costs and higher at intermediate frequency of change. The highly modular nature of the new computational model made this case study straightforward to implement, and reflects the sort of novel studies that can easily be executed with the new model. {\copyright} 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.}},

                A system of nonlinear partial differential equations is proposed as a model for the growth of an avascular-tumour spheroid. The model assumes a continuum of cells in two states, living or dead, and, depending on the concentration of a generic nutrient, the live cells may reproduce (expanding the tumour) or die (causing contraction). These volume changes resulting from cell birth and death generate a velocity field within the spheroid. Numerical solutions of the model reveal that after a period of time the variables settle to a constant profile propagating at a fixed speed. The travelling-wave limit is formulated and analytical solutions are found for a particular case. Numerical results for more general parameters compare well with these analytical solutions. Asymptotic techniques are applied to the physically relevant case of a small death rate, revealing two phases of growth retardation from the initial exponential growth, the first of which is due to nutrient-diffusion limitations and the second to contraction during necrosis. In this limit, maximal and "linear' phase growth speeds can be evaluated in terms of the model parameters.

However, the EM algorithm is deterministic and intrinsically prone to overfitting the training data and being trapped in local optima. In this paper, we propose a hybrid genetic and variational EM (GA-VEM) algorithm for brain MR image segmentation. In this approach, the VEM algorithm is performed to estimate the GMM, and the GA is employed to initialize the hyperparameters of the conjugate prior distributions of GMM parameters involved in the VEM algorithm. Since GA has the potential to achieve global optimization and VEM can steadily avoid overfitting, the hybrid GA-VEM algorithm is capable of overcoming the drawbacks of traditional EM-based methods. We compared our approach to the EM-based, VEM-based, and GA-EM based segmentation algorithms, and the segmentation routines used in the statistical parametric mapping package and FMRIB Software Library in 20 low-resolution and 17 high-resolution brain MR studies. Our results show that the proposed approach can improve substantially the performance of brain MR image segmentation.}},

    abstract = {{Scaling techniques were used to analyze the fractal nature of colonies of 15 cell lines growing in vitro as well as of 16 types of tumor developing in vivo. All cell colonies were found to exhibit exactly the same growth dynamics-which correspond to the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) universality class. MBE dynamics are characterized by 1), a linear growth rate, 2), the constraint of cell proliferation to the colony/tumor border, and 3), surface diffusion of cells at the growing edge. These characteristics were experimentally verified in the studied colonies. That these should show MBE dynamics is in strong contrast with the currently established concept of tumor growth: the kinetics of this type of proliferation rules out exponential or Gompertzian growth. Rather, a clear linear growth regime is followed. The importance of new cell movements-cell diffusion at the tumor border-lies in the fact that tumor growth must be conceived as a competition for space between the tumor and the host, and not for nutrients or other factors. Strong experimental evidence is presented for 16 types of tumor, the growth of which cell surface diffusion may be the main mechanism responsible in vivo. These results explain most of the clinical and biological features of colonies and tumors, offer new theoretical frameworks, and challenge the wisdom of some current clinical strategies.}},

The consequent changes in cell behavior and responsiveness result not only from genetic alterations such as activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, but also from altered production of, or responsiveness to, stimulatory or inhibitory growth and differentiation factors. Among these, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and its signaling effectors act as key determinants of carcinoma cell behavior. The autocrine and paracrine effects of TGF-beta on tumor cells and the tumor micro-environment exert both positive and negative influences on cancer development. Accordingly, the TGF-beta signaling pathway has been considered as both a tumor suppressor pathway and a promoter of tumor progression and invasion. Here we evaluate the role of TGF-beta in tumor development and attempt to reconcile the positive and negative effects of TGF-beta in carcinogenesis.}},

    abstract = {{Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach to modelling systems composed of autonomous, interacting agents. Agent-based modelling is a way to model the dynamics of complex systems and complex adaptive systems. Such systems often self-organize themselves and create emergent order. Agent-based models also include models of behaviour (human or otherwise) and are used to observe the collective effects of agent behaviours and interactions. The development of agent modelling tools, the availability of micro-data, and advances in computation have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications across a variety of domains and disciplines. This article provides a brief introduction to ABMS, illustrates the main concepts and foundations, discusses some recent applications across a variety of disciplines, and identifies methods and toolkits for developing agent models.}},

Inadequate margins may result in high local recurrence, and excessively large resections may lead to poor cosmetic outcome without oncologic benefit.
                A comprehensive search for published trials that examined outcomes after adjuvant RT after BCS for DCIS was performed using MEDLINE and cross referencing available data. Reviews of each study were conducted, and data were extracted. Primary outcome was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) related to surgical margins.
                A total of 4,660 patients were identified from trials examining BCS and RT for DCIS. Patients with negative margins were significantly less likely to experience recurrence than patients with positive margins after RT (odds ratio [OR] = 0.36; 95\% CI, 0.27 to 0.47). A negative margin significantly reduced the risk of IBTR when compared with a close (OR = 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.42 to 0.83) or unknown margin (OR = 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.36 to 0.87). When specific margin thresholds were examined, a 2-mm margin was superior to a margin less than 2 mm (OR = 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.26 to 0.96); however, we saw no significant difference in the rate of IBTR with margins between 2 mm and more than 5 mm (OR = 1.51; 95\% CI, 0.51 to 5.0; P > .05).
                Surgical margins negative for DCIS should be obtained after BCS for DCIS. A margin threshold of 2 mm seems to be as good as a larger margin when BCS for DCIS is combined with RT.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Martin2008Mammographic,
    abstract = {{There is now extensive evidence that mammographic density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer that is associated with large relative and attributable risks for the disease. The epidemiology of mammographic density, including the influences of age, parity and menopause, is consistent with it being a marker of susceptibility to breast cancer, in a manner similar to the concept of 'breast tissue age' described by the Pike model. Mammographic density reflects variations in the tissue composition of the breast. It is associated positively with collagen and epithelial and nonepithelial cells, and negatively with fat. Mammographic density is influenced by some hormones and growth factors as well as by several hormonal interventions. It is also associated with urinary levels of a mutagen. Twin studies have shown that most of the variation in mammographic density is accounted for by genetic factors. The hypothesis that we have developed from these observations postulates that the combined effects of cell proliferation (mitogenesis) and genetic damage to proliferating cells by mutagens (mutagenesis) may underlie the increased risk for breast cancer associated with extensive mammographic density. There is clearly a need for improved understanding of the specific factors that are involved in these processes and of the role played by the several breast tissue components that contribute to density. In particular, identification of the genes that are responsible for most of the variance in percentage density (and of their biological functions) is likely to provide insights into the biology of the breast, and may identify potential targets for preventative strategies in breast cancer.}},

This review presents evidence that mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer, and that risk of breast cancer is four to five times greater in women with density in more than 75\% of the breast than in women with little or no density in the breast. Density in more than 50\% of the breast could account for about a third of breast cancers. The epidemiology of mammographic density is consistent with its being a marker of susceptibility to breast cancer. Twin studies have shown that the proportion of the breast occupied by density, at a given age, is highly heritable, and inherited factors explain 63\% of the variance. Mammographic breast density has the characteristics of a quantitative trait and might be determined by genes that are easier to identify than those for breast cancer itself. The genes that determine breast density might also be associated with risk of breast cancer, and their identification is also likely to provide insights into the biology of the breast and identify potential targets for preventive strategies.}},

The objective of this study was to determine the dose and time dependence of TGF-beta1 as an active agent in penile corporal fibrosis in an animal model.
                A time release method of delivery was developed using sodium alginate microspheres containing recombinant human (rh) TGF-beta1. New Zealand White rabbits were injected intracorporally with a single alginate microsphere either with or without rh-TGF-beta1. Dosage was varied from 325 to 1500 ng./bead. Animals were sacrificed at either three or five days post injection and the penises removed en bloc, examined, and processed for quantitative histomorphometric analysis, staining the sections with Masson's trichrome.
                Alginate microspheres containing [125I]-rh-TGF-beta1 showed slow-release kinetics (t1/2 = 10.5 hours). Histomorphometric analysis of 60 sets of high powered fields/treatment/ animal showed dose dependent decreases in percentage of corporal smooth muscle with TGF-beta1 treatment (750 to 1500 ng./bead). Placebo (alginate microspheres alone) had trabecular smooth muscle content comparable to values previously reported for untreated rabbit corpus cavernosum.
                This study confirms that TGF-beta1 induces fibrosis in situ by altering connective tissue synthesis and hence the structure of the corpus cavernosum. Injection of rh-TGF-beta1 impregnated alginate microspheres into the corpus cavernosum resulted in dose-dependent decreases in percentage of corporal smooth muscle.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Alpkvist2006Threedimensional,
    abstract = {{An innovative type of biofilm model is derived by combining an individual description of microbial particles with a continuum representation of the biofilm matrix. This hybrid model retains the advantages of each approach, while providing a more realistic description of the temporal development of biofilm structure in two or three spatial dimensions. The general model derivation takes into account any possible number of soluble components. These are substrates and metabolic products, which diffuse and react in the biofilm within individual microbial cells. The cells grow, divide, and produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in a multispecies model setting. The EPS matrix is described by a continuum representation as incompressible viscous fluid, which can expand and retract due to generation and consumption processes. The cells move due to a pushing mechanism between cells in colonies and by an advective mechanism supported by the EPS dynamics. Detachment of both cells and EPS follows a continuum approach, whereas cells attach in discrete events. Two case studies are presented for model illustration. Biofilm consolidation is explained by shrinking due to EPS and cell degradation processes. This mechanism describes formation of a denser layer of cells in the biofilm depth and occurrence of an irregularly shaped biofilm surface under nutrient limiting conditions. Micro-colony formation is investigated by growth of autotrophic microbial colonies in an EPS matrix produced by heterotrophic cells. Size and shape of colonies of ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are comparatively studied in a standard biofilm and in biofilms aerated from a membrane side.

The purpose of the present work was to determine whether the products of a newly described LO-like gene (LOXL) that encodes a close homolog of LO, the LO-like (LOL) protein, is associated with extracellular matrix remodeling during fibrotic disorders. Specific antibody against LOL identified proteins of approximately 30, 42, 52 and 68 kd in various cells and in bovine aorta. These proteins were immunochemically distinct from the recombinant LO expressed by fibroblasts and from the bovine aorta LO. The LO gene (LOX) and LOXL were transiently up-regulated at early stages of liver granuloma development in Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice, although the peak of LOL mRNA synthesis preceded that of LO. LOL protein and LO were colocalized at sites of fibrogenesis in human lung fibrosis and in the stromal reaction of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas and of in situ ductal breast tumors. In conclusion, the LOL protein was identified as a secreted protein and localized in the extracellular matrix in active fibrotic diseases and in the early stromal reaction of breast cancer.}},

    abstract = {{The lysyl oxidase gene family members function as extracellular matrix modulating enzymes. We have found that another member of this family, lysyl oxidase related protein-1 (LOR-1), is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer-derived cell lines but not in the nonmetastatic estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, LOR-1 expression in periductal tumor cells of breast carcinomas is significantly correlated with increased tumor malignancy. MCF-7 cells expressing recombinant LOR-1 formed estrogen-dependent tumors that developed much slower than tumors derived from empty vector-transfected MCF-7 cells. The cells of these LOR-1-expressing tumors were surrounded by a high concentration of dense collagen fibers, and the tumors contained many fibrotic foci. Induction of fibrosis in vivo by lysyl oxidase-like enzymes has never been observed before and suggests that LOR-1 may function as an autonomous inducer of fibrosis. The appearance of fibrotic foci in spontaneous breast cancer tumors is correlated with poor prognosis and metastasis, and we, therefore, examined the invasiveness of the LOR-1-expressing tumors. LOR-1-expressing MCF-7 cells invaded the pseudocapsules surrounding the tumors. In contrast, vector-transfected MCF-7 cells did not invade the pseudocapsules. This observation suggests that LOR-1 enhances the malignancy of the tumors. Furthermore, the LOR-1-expressing tumor cells invaded blood vessels, nerves, and muscles adjacent to the tumor, indicating that the LOR-1-expressing MCF-7 cells acquired metastatic properties. We conclude that LOR-1 promotes tumor fibrosis and tumor invasiveness simultaneously, which indicates that these two processes may be associated.}},

Later experiments in mice deficient in specific MMPs revealed that host-derived MMPs play a critical role not only in tumor cell invasion, but also in carcinogenesis, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and metastasis. Tumor cells secrete many factors, cytokines and chemokines that directly or indirectly increase the expression of these MMPs in the tumor microenvironment where they exert extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading and sheddase activities. The knowledge of the complex role that stromal-derived MMPs play in the interaction between tumor cells and stromal cells should allow us to consider specific windows in cancer treatment when MMP inhibition could have a valuable therapeutic effect.}},

The cellular localization and the activity of MMPs are tightly controlled at both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels.

This review is focused on two, entirely different MMPs, one of which is membrane-tethered and another of which is soluble (MT1-MMP and MMP-26, respectively) from twenty four known human MMPs. Our recent studies determined that both of these enzymes functioned at unexpected cellular compartments and it was resulted in the identification of novel proteolytic pathways, whose significance we only partially comprehend as of this writing. It is reasonable, however, to hypothesize from these data that many individual MMPs perform in a similar manner and display a much broader range of functions compared to what we earlier thought.}},

However, recent reports have demonstrated novel roles for LOX, including the ability to regulate gene transcription, motility/migration, and cell adhesion. These diverse functions have led researchers to hypothesize that LOX may have multiple roles affecting both extra- and intracellular cell function(s). Particularly noteworthy is aberrant LOX expression and activity that have been observed in various cancerous tissues and neoplastic cell lines. Both down and upregulation of LOX in tumor tissues and cancer cell lines have been described, suggesting a dual role for LOX as a tumor suppressor, as well as a metastasis promoter gene--creating a conundrum within the LOX research field. Here, we review the body of evidence on LOX gene expression, regulation, and function(s) in various cancer cell types and tissues, as well as stromal-tumor cell interactions. Lastly, we will examine putative mechanisms in which LOX facilitates breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Taken together, the literature demonstrates the increasingly important role(s) that LOX may play in regulating tumor progression and the necessity to elucidate its myriad mechanisms of action in order to identify potentially novel therapeutics.}},

The histogenesis of these tumours is still unclear, but most evidence suggests that the sarcomatous component originates from mesenchymal conversion of carcinomatous cells. We found that carcinomatous portions of the tumours were associated with linear basement membrane-like deposition of laminin, type IV collagen and heparan sulphate proteoglycan that partially circumscribed the epithelial nests. The sarcomatous components produced an extracellular matrix immunoreactive to fibronectin, type I, III and VI collagens and tenascin. However, in two cases, in some sarcomatous areas, focal pericellular staining for antibodies to laminin and type IV collagen was seen. These results indicate that modifications observed in the double tissue component of these tumours involve not only the cell shape and the cytoskeleton, but also the components of the extracellular matrix. The significance of these findings and their relevance in the understanding of the phenotypic pattern changes of these biphasic tumours are discussed.}},

Among invasive tumors, immunoreactivity for laminin was expressed in 31\% of cases and FN in 66\%, whereas TEM revealed BM in only 4 out of 52 (8\%) studied cases. Tumors measuring 10 mm or less were more often laminin-positive and FN-negative than larger tumors. There was a tendency for lymph node negative tumors to express laminin more often, but there was no relation between lymph node status and FN. Laminin immunostaining proved to be very useful in identifying vascular invasion. The laminin and FN immunoreactivity showed no significant correlation with overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) of the breast cancer patients.

Tenascin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, present in embryonal and fetal tissues, which is also found in the stroma of various benign and malignant pathologies. We studied the expression and immunohistochemical behavior of tenascin in specimens of invasive and preinvasive breast cancer in order to assess its potential role as a marker for tumor invasion.
                Sixty-eight specimens including 29 noninvasive ductal cancers, 12 invasive ductal cancers, 5 adenoses, 7 fibroadenomas, and 15 samples of normal human breast tissue were evaluated. An immunofluorescent microscopic technique was used for analysis of the localization and distribution of tenascin. Paraffin-embedded biopsies were incubated with primary monoclonal anti-tenascin antibodies (1:25, Dako-tenascin, TN2). Subsequently, trimethylrhodamine-isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (rabbit anti-mouse immunglobulins (Dakopatts, Denmark) were added to visualize the protein.
                A significant tenascin expression was observed around the ducts in all samples of patients with preinvasive breast cancers. Intensive staining was also found in the periductal stroma of all specimens of patients with invasive breast cancers. Benign breast lesions showed weaker reactivity. No tenascin expression was detectable in normal human breasts, while tissue samples of in situ cancers presented variable staining intensities positively correlating with the degree of differentiation.
                Tenascin immunofluorescence may prove a suitable and helpful adjunct for diagnosing malignant disease and for predicting the invasive potential of premalignant breast lesions.

@article{qanitabaker:Quinn1997Cytological,
    abstract = {{The traditional architecture based classification system of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has been criticised on the grounds that individual lesions often show more than one pattern resulting in a large mixed category. New DCIS classification systems have emphasised the importance of cytological grade, which is reputed to be more uniformly expressed throughout a lesion. This study investigates the hypothesis that cytological heterogeneity is less common than architectural heterogeneity within DCIS lesions.
                121 cases of DCIS were graded as poorly, intermediately, or well differentiated according to a recently developed classification system that employs cytonuclear morphology as the major diagnostic criterion. Cases were categorised as pure when only one grade was present and as mixed if more than one grade was observed. Architecturally the cases were classified as solid, cribriform, micropapillary, or papillary and were described as pure if only one architectural pattern was present and as mixed if more than one pattern was seen. The incidence of cytological heterogeneity was compared with that of architectural heterogeneity. The presence of necrosis was assessed as an independent parameter and the relation to DCIS grade evaluated.
                Using the cytology based classification system 102 cases (84\%) were classified as pure (65 poorly differentiated, 25 intermediately differentiated, and 12 well differentiated) and 19 cases (16\%) as mixed. Extensive necrosis was observed in 61 (50\%) cases and was closely correlated to DCIS grade. Architecturally 46 cases (38\%) were classified as pure (38 solid, 5 cribriform, 2 micropapillary, and 1 papillary) and 75 (62\%) as mixed.
                Cytological heterogeneity is much less common than architectural heterogeneity in DCIS lesions. The assessment of cytonuclear morphology is therefore likely to provide more consistent information about DCIS, particularly in small biopsy specimens where only part of the lesion may be available for examination.}},

    abstract = {{We have developed an off-lattice hybrid discrete-continuum (OLHDC) model of tumor growth and invasion. The continuum part of the OLHDC model describes microenvironmental components such as matrix-degrading enzymes, nutrients or oxygen, and extracellular matrix (ECM) concentrations, whereas the discrete portion represents individual cell behavior such as cell cycle, cell-cell, and cell-ECM interactions and cell motility by the often-used persistent random walk, which can be depicted by the Langevin equation. Using this framework of the OLHDC model, we develop a phenomenologically realistic and bio/physically relevant model that encompasses the experimentally observed superdiffusive behavior (at short times) of mammalian cells. When systemic simulations based on the OLHDC model are performed, tumor growth and its morphology are found to be strongly affected by cell-cell adhesion and haptotaxis. There is a combination of the strength of cell-cell adhesion and haptotaxis in which fingerlike shapes, characteristic of invasive tumor, are observed.

    abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:The importance of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer has been increasingly recognized. Critical molecular changes in the tumor stroma accompanying cancer progression, however, remain largely unknown. We conducted a comparative analysis of global gene expression changes in the stromal and epithelial compartments during breast cancer progression from normal to preinvasive to invasive ductal carcinoma.METHODS:We combined laser capture microdissection and gene expression microarrays to analyze 14 patient-matched normal epithelium, normal stroma, tumor epithelium and tumor-associated stroma specimens. Differential gene expression and gene ontology analyses were performed.RESULTS:Tumor-associated stroma undergoes extensive gene expression changes during cancer progression, to a similar extent as that seen in the malignant epithelium. Highly upregulated genes in the tumor-associated stroma include constituents of the extracellular matrix and matrix metalloproteases, and cell-cycle-related genes. Decreased expression of cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins and increased expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins were observed in both the tumor epithelium and the stroma. The transition from preinvasive to invasive growth was accompanied by increased expression of several matrix metalloproteases (MMP2, MMP11 and MMP14). Furthermore, as observed in malignant epithelium, a gene expression signature of histological tumor grade also exists in the stroma, with high-grade tumors associated with increased expression of genes involved in immune response.CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that the tumor microenvironment participates in tumorigenesis even before tumor cells invade into stroma, and that it may play important roles in the transition from preinvasive to invasive growth. The immune cells in the tumor stroma may be exploited by the malignant epithelial cells in high-grade tumors for aggressive invasive growth.}},

    abstract = {{Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)—a significant precursor to invasive breast cancer—is typically diagnosed as microcalcifications in mammograms. However, the effective use of mammograms and other patient data to plan treatment has been restricted by our limited understanding of DCIS growth and calcification. We develop a mechanistic, agent-based cell model and apply it to DCIS. Cell motion is determined by a balance of biomechanical forces. We use potential functions to model interactions with the basement membrane and amongst cells of unequal size and phenotype. Each cell's phenotype is determined by genomic/proteomic- and microenvironment-dependent stochastic processes. Detailed  ” sub-models” describe cell volume changes during proliferation and necrosis; we are the first to account for cell calcification. We introduce the first patient-specific calibration method to fully constrain the model based upon clinically-accessible histopathology data. After simulating 45 days of solid-type DCIS with comedonecrosis, the model predicts: necrotic cell lysis acts as a biomechanical stress relief and is responsible for the linear DCIS growth observed in mammography; the rate of DCIS advance varies with the duct radius; the tumour grows 7–10 mm per year—consistent with mammographic data; and the mammographic and (post-operative) pathologic sizes are linearly correlated—in quantitative agreement with the clinical literature. Patient histopathology matches the predicted DCIS microstructure: an outer proliferative rim surrounds a stratified necrotic core with nuclear debris on its outer edge and calcification in the centre. This work illustrates that computational modelling can provide new insight on the biophysical underpinnings of cancer. It may 1 day be possible to augment a patient's mammography and other imaging with rigorously-calibrated models that help select optimal surgical margins based upon the patient's histopathologic data. \^{a}º We introduce the first patient-specific calibration to individual pathology data. \^{a}º Biomechanics of necrotic cell lysis leads to linear growth at 7.5–10.2 mm/year. \^{a}º The model predicts a linear correlation between the mammography and pathology sizes. \^{a}º The predicted layered necrotic core microstructure gives new insights on mammography. \^{a}º Key model predictions are quantitatively validated to pathology and radiology data.}},

Cells dynamically adapt to force by modifying their behaviour and remodelling their microenvironment. They also sense these forces through mechanoreceptors and respond by exerting reciprocal actomyosin- and cytoskeletal-dependent cell-generated force by a process termed 'mechanoreciprocity'. Loss of mechanoreciprocity has been shown to promote the progression of disease, including cancer. Moreover, the mechanical properties of a tissue contribute to disease progression, compromise treatment and might also alter cancer risk.

The importance of ECM remodeling to cancer is appreciated; the relevance of stiffening is less clear. We found that breast tumorigenesis is accompanied by collagen crosslinking, ECM stiffening, and increased focal adhesions. Induction of collagen crosslinking stiffened the ECM, promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3 kinase (PI3K) activity, and induced the invasion of an oncogene-initiated epithelium. Inhibition of integrin signaling repressed the invasion of a premalignant epithelium into a stiffened, crosslinked ECM and forced integrin clustering promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3K signaling, and induced the invasion of a premalignant epithelium. Consistently, reduction of lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinking prevented MMTV-Neu-induced fibrosis, decreased focal adhesions and PI3K activity, impeded malignancy, and lowered tumor incidence. These data show how collagen crosslinking can modulate tissue fibrosis and stiffness to force focal adhesions, growth factor signaling and breast malignancy.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Verma2007Matrix,
    abstract = {{Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a large family of calcium-dependent zinc-containing endopeptidases, which are responsible for the tissue remodeling and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including collagens, elastins, gelatin, matrix glycoproteins, and proteoglycan. They are regulated by hormones, growth factors, and cytokines, and are involved in ovarian functions. MMPs are excreted by a variety of connective tissue and pro-inflammatory cells including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. These enzymes are expressed as zymogens, which are subsequently processed by other proteolytic enzymes (such as serine proteases, furin, plasmin, and others) to generate the active forms. Matrix metalloproteinases are considered as promising targets for the treatment of cancer due to their strong involvement in malignant pathologies. Clinical/preclinical studies on MMP inhibition in tumor models brought positive results raising the idea that the development of strategies to inhibit MMPs may be proved to be a powerful tool to fight against cancer. However, the presence of an inherent flexibility in the MMP active-site limits dramatically the accurate modeling of MMP-inhibitor complexes. The interest in the application of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) has steadily increased in recent decades and we hope it may be useful in elucidating the mechanisms of chemical-biological interactions for this enzyme. In the present review, an attempt has been made to explore the in-depth knowledge from the classification of this enzyme to the clinical trials of their inhibitors. A total number of 92 QSAR models (44 published and 48 new formulated QSAR models) have also been presented to understand the chemical-biological interactions. QSAR results on the inhibition of various compound series against MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -12, -13, and -14 reveal a number of interesting points. The most important of these are hydrophobicity and molar refractivity, which are the most important determinants of the activity.}},

The regulatory cytokine TGFbeta exerts tumor-suppressive effects that cancer cells must elude for malignant evolution. Yet, paradoxically, TGFbeta also modulates processes such as cell invasion, immune regulation, and microenvironment modification that cancer cells may exploit to their advantage. Consequently, the output of a TGFbeta response is highly contextual throughout development, across different tissues, and also in cancer. The mechanistic basis and clinical relevance of TGFbeta's role in cancer is becoming increasingly clear, paving the way for a better understanding of the complexity and therapeutic potential of this pathway.

    abstract = {{Mammographically dense breast tissue is one of the greatest risk factors for developing breast carcinoma, yet the associated molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Importantly, regions of high breast density are associated with increased stromal collagen and epithelial cell content. We set out to determine whether increased collagen-matrix density, in the absence of stromal cells, was sufficient to promote proliferation and invasion characteristic of a malignant phenotype in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. We demonstrate that increased collagen-matrix density increases matrix stiffness to promote an invasive phenotype. High matrix stiffness resulted in increased formation of activated three-dimensional (3D)-matrix adhesions and a chronically elevated outside-in/inside-out focal adhesion (FA) kinase (FAK)-Rho signaling loop, which was necessary to generate and maintain the invasive phenotype. Moreover, this signaling network resulted in hyperactivation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which promoted growth of mammary epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo and activated a clinically relevant proliferation signature that predicts patient outcome. Hence, the current data provide compelling evidence for the importance of the mechanical features of the microenvironment, and suggest that mechanotransduction in these cells occurs through a FAK-Rho-ERK signaling network with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a bottleneck through which much of the response to mechanical stimuli is regulated. As such, we propose that increased matrix stiffness explains part of the mechanism behind increased epithelial proliferation and cancer risk in human patients with high breast tissue density.}},

                With the aim of inhibiting cancer growth and reducing the risk of metastasis, pharmaceutical companies in the early 1990s developed anti-metastatic agents called inhibitors of metalloproteinases (MMPi). Despite the promising results obtained in pre-clinical studies, results of Phase III trials have been somewhat disappointing for late stage cancer patients. With the aim of mathematically investigating this therapeutic failure, we developed a mechanistically based model which integrates cell cycle regulation and macroscopic tumor dynamics. By simulating the model, we evaluated the efficacy of MMPi therapy. Simulation results predict the lack of efficacy of MMPi in advanced cancer patients. The theoretical model may aid in evaluating the efficacy of anti-metastatic therapies, thus benefiting the design of prospective clinical trials.

Matrix degradation can additionally promote malignant progression and metastasis. Tumor hypoxia is functionally linked to altered stromal-epithelial interactions. Hypoxia additionally induces the expression of pro-migratory, survival and invasion genes, and up-regulates expression of ECM components and modifying enzymes, to enhance tumor progression and metastasis. Synergistic interactions between matrix remodeling and tumor hypoxia influence common mechanisms that maximize tumor progression and cooperate to drive metastasis.

    abstract = {{Human breast epithelium and the stroma are separated by a layer of myoepithelial (ME) cells and basement membrane, whose disruption is a prerequisite for tumor invasion. The dissolution of the basement membrane is traditionally attributed primarily to an over-production of proteolytic enzymes by the tumor or the surrounding stromal cells. The results from matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor clinical trials, however, suggest that this "protease-centered" hypothesis is inadequate to completely reflect the molecular mechanisms of tumor invasion. The causes and signs of ME cell layer disruption are currently under-explored. Our studies revealed that a subset of pre- and micro-invasive tumors contained focal disruptions in the ME cell layers. These disruptions were associated with immunohistochemical and genetic alterations in the overlying tumor cells, including the loss of estrogen receptor expression, a higher frequency of loss of heterozygosity, and a higher expression of cell cycle, angiogenesis, and invasion-related genes. Focal ME layer disruptions were also associated with a higher rate of epithelial proliferation and leukocyte infiltration. We propose the novel hypothesis that a localized death of ME cells and immunoreactions that accompany an external environmental insult or internal genetic alterations are triggering factors for ME layer disruptions, basement membrane degradation, and subsequent tumor progression and invasion.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Kim2010Transformed,
    abstract = {{It is well known that tumor and its microenvironment, or stroma, interact with each other and that this interaction plays a critical role in tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. This interaction consists of complex relations between tumor cells, stromal cells such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells and immunocytes, the vascular system, the extracellular matrix, and cytokines secreted by the cells. Understanding these relationships may lead to new therapeutic approaches to cancer. In the present paper, we consider tumor-stroma crosstalk in a simple in vitro situation which involves interaction between tumor epithelial cells from breast cancer and a microenvironment consisting of just fibroblasts. The two populations of cells are separated by a semi-permeable membrane that allows only cytokines to cross over. We develop a mathematical model that includes two critical growth factors: TGF-beta, produced by the tumor cells, and EGF, secreted by the fibroblasts. The TGF-beta modifies the microenvironment by transforming fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts secrete higher concentrations of EGF than fibroblasts, thereby, increasing the proliferation of tumor cells. Thus already in this simple setup one sees a mutual interaction between tumor cells and their microenvironment. We conducted experiments which show good agreement with the model's simulations, hence confirming the model's ability to predict aspects of tumor cell behavior in response to signaling from fibroblasts.}},

                The major cellular components of tumor microenvironment, referred to as the cancer stroma, are composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts that support tumor epithelial growth, invasion and therapeutic resistance. Thus when we speak of developing therapies that address tumor heterogeneity it is not only a matter of different mutations within the tumor epithelia. While individual mutations in the stromal compartment are controversial, the heterogeneity in fibroblastic population in a single tumor is not up for debate. Cooperative interaction among heterotypic fibroblasts and tumor cells contribute to cancer progression. Therefore to tackle solid tumors, we need to understand its complex microenvironment. Here we review some seminal developments in the field of tumor microenvironment, mainly focusing on cancer-associated fibroblast.

The models describe the progression through the grades of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 1, 2, and 3, and through the grades of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) 1, 2, and 3. The first three pathways, termed linear, nonlinear, and branched, describe DCIS as a progenitor of IDC, and grades of DCIS progressing into grades of IDC. The fourth pathway, termed parallel, describes DCIS and IDC as diverging from a common progenitor and progressing through grades in parallel. The best transition rates for the linear, nonlinear, and branched pathways were sought using a random search in combination with a directed search based on the Nelder–Mead simplex method. Parameter values for the parallel pathway were determined with heuristic graphs. Results of computer simulation were compared with clinically observed frequencies of grades of DCIS and grades of IDC that were reported to occur together in heterogeneous tumors. Each of the four pathways could simulate frequencies that resembled, to varying degrees, the clinical observations. The parallel pathway produced the best correspondence with clinical observations. These results quantify the traditional descriptions in which grades of DCIS are the progenitors of grades of IDC. The results also raise the alternative possibility that, in some tumors with both components, DCIS and IDC may have diverged from a common progenitor.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Smallbone2007Metabolic,
    abstract = {{Successful adaptation to varying microenvironmental constraints plays a crucial role during carcinogenesis. We develop a hybrid cellular automation approach to investigate the cell-microenvironmental interactions that mediate somatic evolution of cancer cells. This allows investigation of the hypothesis that regions of premalignant lesions develop a substrate-limited environment as proliferation carries cells away from blood vessels which remain separated by the intact basement membrane. We find that selective forces in tumoural regions furthest from the blood supply act to favour cells whose metabolism is best suited to respond to local changes in oxygen, glucose and pH levels. The model predicts three phases of somatic evolution. Initially, cell survival and proliferation is limited due to diminished oxygen levels. This promotes adaptation to a second phase of growth dominated by cells with constitutively up-regulated glycolysis, less reliant on oxygen for ATP production. Increased glycolysis induces acidification of the local environment, limiting proliferation and inducing cell death through necrosis and apoptosis. This promotes a third phase of cellular evolution, with emergence of phenotypes resistant to acid-induced toxicity. This emergent cellular phenotype has a significant proliferative advantage because it will consistently acidify the local environment in a way that is toxic to its competitors but harmless to itself. The model's results suggest this sequence is essential in the transition from self-limited premalignant growth to invasive cancer, and, therefore, that this transition may be delayed or prevented through novel strategies directed towards interrupting the hypoxia-glycolysis-acidosis cycle.}},

The objective of the present study was to characterize and validate an in vitro model of the interaction between small numbers of human breast cancer cells and human fibroblasts.
                We measured the clonogenic growth of small numbers of human breast cancer cells co-cultured in direct contact with serum-activated, normal human fibroblasts. Using DNA microarrays, we also characterized the gene expression profile of the serum-activated fibroblasts. In order to validate the in vivo relevance of our experiments, we then analyzed clinical samples of metastatic breast cancer for the presence of myofibroblasts expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin.
                Clonogenic growth of human breast cancer cells obtained directly from in situ and invasive tumors was dramatically and consistently enhanced when the tumor cells were co-cultured in direct contact with serum-activated fibroblasts. This effect was abolished when the cells were co-cultured in transwells separated by permeable inserts. The fibroblasts in our experimental model exhibited a gene expression signature characteristic of 'serum response' (i.e. myofibroblasts). Immunostaining of human samples of metastatic breast cancer tissue confirmed that myofibroblasts are in direct contact with breast cancer cells.
                Serum-activated fibroblasts promote the clonogenic growth of human breast cancer cells in vitro through a mechanism that involves direct physical contact between the cells. This model shares many important molecular and phenotypic similarities with the fibroblasts that are naturally found in breast cancers.}},

Formation of four specific intraductal tumour patterns, micropapillary, cribriform, tufting and solid, are presented in this paper together with a discussion on gradual dedifferentiation of ductal epithelial cells that gives rise to these distinct carcinomas.

@article{qanitabaker:Quinn1997Cytological,
    abstract = {{AIM: The traditional architecture based classification system of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has been criticised on the grounds that individual lesions often show more than one pattern resulting in a large mixed category. New DCIS classification systems have emphasised the importance of cytological grade, which is reputed to be more uniformly expressed throughout a lesion. This study investigates the hypothesis that cytological heterogeneity is less common than architectural heterogeneity within DCIS lesions. METHODS: 121 cases of DCIS were graded as poorly, intermediately, or well differentiated according to a recently developed classification system that employs cytonuclear morphology as the major diagnostic criterion. Cases were categorised as pure when only one grade was present and as mixed if more than one grade was observed. Architecturally the cases were classified as solid, cribriform, micropapillary, or papillary and were described as pure if only one architectural pattern was present and as mixed if more than one pattern was seen. The incidence of cytological heterogeneity was compared with that of architectural heterogeneity. The presence of necrosis was assessed as an independent parameter and the relation to DCIS grade evaluated. RESULTS: Using the cytology based classification system 102 cases (84\%) were classified as pure (65 poorly differentiated, 25 intermediately differentiated, and 12 well differentiated) and 19 cases (16\%) as mixed. Extensive necrosis was observed in 61 (50\%) cases and was closely correlated to DCIS grade. Architecturally 46 cases (38\%) were classified as pure (38 solid, 5 cribriform, 2 micropapillary, and 1 papillary) and 75 (62\%) as mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Cytological heterogeneity is much less common than architectural heterogeneity in DCIS lesions. The assessment of cytonuclear morphology is therefore likely to provide more consistent information about DCIS, particularly in small biopsy specimens where only part of the lesion may be available for examination.}},

    abstract = {{The tissue microenvironment regulates mammary gland development and tissue homeostasis through soluble, insoluble and cellular cues that operate within the three dimensional architecture of the gland. Disruption of these critical cues and loss of tissue architecture characterize breast tumors. The developing and lactating mammary gland are also subject to a plethora of tensional forces that shape the morphology of the gland and orchestrate its functionally differentiated state. Moreover, malignant transformation of the breast is associated with dramatic changes in gland tension that include elevated compression forces, high tensional resistance stresses and increased extracellular matrix stiffness. Chronically increased mammary gland tension may influence tumor growth, perturb tissue morphogenesis, facilitate tumor invasion, and alter tumor survival and treatment responsiveness. Because mammary tissue differentiation is compromised by high mechanical force and transformed cells exhibit altered mechanoresponsiveness, malignant transformation of the breast may be functionally linked to perturbed tensional-homeostasis. Accordingly, it will be important to define the role of tensional force in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. Additionally, it will be critical to identify the key molecular elements regulating tensional-homeostasis of the mammary gland and thereafter to characterize their associated mechanotransduction pathways.}},

To improve the understanding of the relation between morphology and time course, we have developed a 2D in silico particle model of the growth of DCIS within a single breast duct. This model considers mechanical effects such as cellular adhesion and intra-ductal pressure, and biological features including proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, and cell polarity. Using this model, we find that different regions of parameter space generate distinct morphological subtypes of DCIS, so elucidating the relation between morphology and time course. Furthermore, we find that tumors with similar architectures may in fact be produced through different mechanisms, and we propose future work to further disentangle the mechanisms involved in DCIS progression.}},

                Mathematical modeling and computational analysis are essential for understanding the dynamics of the complex gene networks that control normal development and homeostasis, and can help to understand how circumvention of that control leads to abnormal outcomes such as cancer. Our objectives here are to discuss the different mechanisms by which the local biochemical and mechanical microenvironment, which is comprised of various signaling molecules, cell types and the extracellular matrix (ECM), affects the progression of potentially-cancerous cells, and to present new results on two aspects of these effects. We first deal with the major processes involved in the progression from a normal cell to a cancerous cell at a level accessible to a general scientific readership, and we then outline a number of mathematical and computational issues that arise in cancer modeling. In Section 2 we present results from a model that deals with the effects of the mechanical properties of the environment on tumor growth, and in Section 3 we report results from a model of the signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment (TME), and how their interactions affect the development of breast cancer. The results emphasize anew the complexities of the interactions within the TME and their effect on tumor growth, and show that tumor progression is not solely determined by the presence of a clone of mutated immortal cells, but rather that it can be 'community-controlled'.

    abstract = {{This paper is concerned with early development of transformed epithelial cells (TECs) in the presence of fibroblasts in the tumor micro-environment. These two types of cells interact by means of cytokines such as transforming growth factor (TGF- β ) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) secreted, respectively, by the TECs and the fibroblasts. As this interaction proceeds, TGF- β induces fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts which secrete EGF at a larger rate than fibroblasts. We monitor the entire process in silico, in a setup which mimics experiments in a Tumor Chamber Invasion Assay, where a semi-permeable membrane coated by extracellular matrix (ECM) is placed between two chambers, one containing TECs and another containing fibroblasts. We develop a mathematical model, based on a system of PDEs, that includes the interaction between TECs, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, TGF- β , and EGF, and we show how model parameters affect tumor progression. The model is used to generate several hypotheses on how to slow tumor growth and invasion. In an Appendix, it is proved that the mathematical model has a unique global in-time solution.}},

    abstract = {{Conceptual models of carcinogenesis typically consist of an evolutionary sequence of heritable changes in genes controlling proliferation, apoptosis, and senescence. We propose that these steps are necessary but not sufficient to produce invasive breast cancer because intraductal tumour growth is also constrained by hypoxia and acidosis that develop as cells proliferate into the lumen and away from the underlying vessels. This requires evolution of glycolytic and acid-resistant phenotypes that, we hypothesise, is critical for emergence of invasive cancer. Mathematical models demonstrate severe hypoxia and acidosis in regions of intraductal tumours more than 100 μm from the basement membrane. Subsequent evolution of glycolytic and acid-resistant phenotypes leads to invasive proliferation. Multicellular spheroids recapitulating ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) microenvironmental conditions demonstrate upregulated glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) as adaptation to hypoxia followed by growth into normoxic regions in qualitative agreement with model predictions. Clinical specimens of DCIS exhibit periluminal distribution of GLUT-1 and Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) indicating transcriptional activation by hypoxia and clusters of the same phenotype in the peripheral, presumably normoxic regions similar to the pattern predicted by the models and observed in spheroids. Upregulated GLUT-1 and NHE-1 were observed in microinvasive foci and adjacent intraductal cells. Adaptation to hypoxia and acidosis may represent key events in transition from in situ to invasive cancer.}},

Interactions between the expansive forces created by tumour cell proliferation and the stresses that develop in the compliant basement membrane are studied using numerical and analytical techniques. Particular attention focuses on the impact that proteolytic enzymes have on the tumour's progression. As the tumour expands and the duct wall deforms, the tumour cells are subjected to mechanical and nutritional stresses caused by high pressures and oxygen deprivation. Such stresses may stimulate the cells to produce proteolytic enzymes that degrade the duct wall, making it more compliant and prone to penetration by the tumour cells. We use our model to compare these two hypotheses for enzyme production and find that mechanical stress is likely the dominant mechanism, with the wall deforming most at the centre of the duct. We then discuss the biological implications of our theoretical results and suggest possible directions for future work.}},

    abstract = {{Ductal carcinoma in situ represents about 20\% of all tumours diagnosed within mammographic screening programs. The natural history of DCIS is poorly understood, as it cannot be observed directly. Estimates of the proportion of DCIS that progress to invasive cancer, as well as factors that may influence progression, are important for clinical management. Here we review various sources of evidence regarding the natural history of DCIS.
                We identified relevant publications of studies on: follow-up studies of DCIS initially misdiagnosed as benign, studies of recurrence of DCIS as invasive cancer, autopsy studies, studies of risk factors for DCIS, animal studies and studies that used mathematical models to study growth of DCIS and invasive cancer. Data sources included the MEDLINE data base, searches of articles cited in key reviews and editorials.
                The most direct evidence regarding the progression of DCIS to invasive cancer comes from studies where DCIS was initially misdiagnosed as benign and treated by biopsy alone. These studies suggest that between 14-53\% of DCIS may progress to invasive cancer over a period of 10 or more years. The reported prevalence of undiagnosed DCIS in autopsy studies, of approximately 9\%, has been used to suggest a larger reservoir of DCIS may exist in the population. All types of study designs reviewed had limitations that may bias the estimate of progression in either direction.
                The available evidence suggests not all DCIS will progress to invasive cancer in the medium term but precise estimates of progression are not possible given the limitations of the data. Mathematical modelling of various scenarios of progression and studies of genetic factors involved in progression may shed further light on the natural history of DCIS.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Enderling2007Mathematical,
    abstract = {{Cancer development is a stepwise process through which normal somatic cells acquire mutations which enable them to escape their normal function in the tissue and become self-sufficient in survival. The number of mutations depends on the patient's age, genetic susceptibility and on the exposure of the patient to carcinogens throughout their life. It is believed that in every malignancy 4–6 crucial similar mutations have to occur on cancer-related genes. These genes are classified as oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) which gain or lose their function respectively, after they have received one mutative hit or both of their alleles have been knocked out. With the acquisition of each of the necessary mutations the transformed cell gains a selective advantage over normal cells, and the mutation will spread throughout the tissue via clonal expansion. We present a simplified model of this mutation and expansion process, in which we assume that the loss of two TSGs is sufficient to give rise to a cancer. Our mathematical model of the stepwise development of breast cancer verifies the idea that the normal mutation rate in genes is only sufficient to give rise to a tumour within a clinically observable time if a high number of breast stem cells and TSGs exist or genetic instability is involved as a driving force of the mutation pathway. Furthermore, our model shows that if a mutation occurred in stem cells pre-puberty, and formed a field of cells with this mutation through clonal formation of the breast, it is most likely that a tumour will arise from within this area. We then apply different treatment strategies, namely surgery and adjuvant external beam radiotherapy and targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) and use the model to identify different sources of local recurrence and analyse their prevention.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Enderling2006Mathematical,
    abstract = {{Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (Targit) is a new concept of partial breast irradiation where single fraction radiotherapy is delivered directly to the tumour bed. Apart from logistic advantages, this strategy minimizes the risk of missing the tumour bed and avoids delay between surgery and radiotherapy. It is presently being compared with the standard fractionated external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in randomized trials. In this paper we present a mathematical model for the growth and invasion of a solid tumour into a domain of tissue (in this case breast tissue), and then a model for surgery and radiation treatment of this tumour. We use the established linear-quadratic (LQ) model to compute the survival probabilities for both tumour cells and irradiated breast tissue and then simulate the effects of conventional EBRT and Targit. True local recurrence of the tumour could arise either from stray tumour cells, or the tumour bed that harbours morphologically normal cells having a predisposition to genetic changes, such as a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in genes that are crucial for tumourigenesis, e.g. tumour suppressor genes (TSGs). Our mathematical model predicts that the single high dose of radiotherapy delivered by Targit would result in eliminating all these sources of recurrence, whereas the fractionated EBRT would eliminate stray tumour cells, but allow (by virtue of its very schedule) the cells with LOH in TSGs or cell-cycle checkpoint genes to pass on low-dose radiation-induced DNA damage and consequently mutations that may favour the development of a new tumour. The mathematical model presented here is an initial attempt to model a biologically complex phenomenon that has until now received little attention in the literature and provides a 'proof of principle' that it is possible to produce clinically testable hypotheses on the effects of different approaches of radiotherapy for breast cancer.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND Studies of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)  ” treated” by diagnostic biopsy alone have been rare, but provide important opportunities to gain insights into the natural history of these lesions. METHODS During a review of 1877 breast biopsy specimens in a nested case–control study of benign breast disease and breast carcinoma risk, the authors identified 13 biopsy specimens with DCIS that were originally diagnosed as benign. Because each of these women was initially given a benign diagnosis, they received no treatment beyond the diagnostic biopsy. RESULTS When compared with women with nonproliferative lesions, the odds ratio (OR) for the development of invasive breast carcinoma among those with retrospectively identified DCIS (n = 6) was 13.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.7–49.7). The OR for the development of any subsequent invasive or in situ breast carcinoma event (n = 10) was 20.1 (95\% CI, 6.1–66. 5). A retrospective review of these DCIS biopsy specimens revealed that the nuclear grade was low in four lesions, intermediate in six, and high in three. None showed comedo-type necrosis. Invasive carcinomas developed among women with DCIS of all nuclear grades. All 10 breast carcinoma events (100\%) were in the ipsilateral breast. CONCLUSIONS These results provided further evidence that patients with DCIS who received no treatment beyond a diagnostic biopsy were at substantially increased risk for developing ipsilateral invasive breast carcinoma, and that the increased risk in this setting was seen in DCIS of low, intermediate, and high nuclear grades.

                A computer simulation is used to model ductal carcinoma in situ, a form of non-invasive breast cancer. The simulation uses known histological morphology, cell types, and stochastic cell proliferation to evolve tumorous growth within a duct. The ductal simulation is based on a hybrid cellular automaton design using genetic rules to determine each cell's behavior. The genetic rules are a mutable abstraction that demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in a population. Our goal was to examine the role (if any) that recently discovered mammary stem cell hierarchies play in genetic heterogeneity, DCIS initiation and aggressiveness. Results show that simpler progenitor hierarchies result in greater genetic heterogeneity and evolve DCIS significantly faster. However, the more complex progenitor hierarchy structure was able to sustain the rapid reproduction of a cancer cell population for longer periods of time.

    abstract = {{Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-invasive carcinoma of the breast that exhibits several distinct morphologies but the link between morphology and patient outcome is not clear. We hypothesize that different mechanisms of growth may still result in similar 2D morphologies, which may look different in 3D. To elucidate the connection between growth and 3D morphology, we reconstruct the 3D architecture of cribriform DCIS from resected patient material. We produce a fully automated algorithm that aligns, segments, and reconstructs 3D architectures from microscopy images of 2D serial sections from human specimens. The alignment algorithm is based on normalized cross correlation, the segmentation algorithm uses histogram equilization, Otsu's thresholding, and morphology techniques to segment the duct and cribra. The reconstruction method combines these images in 3D. We show that two distinct 3D architectures are indeed found in samples whose 2D histological sections are similarly identified as cribriform DCIS. These differences in architecture support the hypothesis that luminal spaces may form due to different mechanisms, either isolated cell death or merging fronds, leading to the different architectures. We find that out of 15 samples, 6 were found to have 'bubble-like' cribra, 6 were found to have 'tube-like' criba and 3 were 'unknown.' We propose that the 3D architectures found, 'bubbles' and 'tubes', account for some of the heterogeneity of the disease and may be prognostic indicators of different patient outcomes.}},

    abstract = {{Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is the most common precursor to invasive carcinoma (IC), the second-leading cause of death in women in USA. There has been great progress in modeling DCIS at both the cellular scale (e.g., using cellular automata and agent-based models) and the population scale (e.g., using partial differential equations or systems of ordinary differential equations), but these past efforts have been difficult to calibrate with patient-specific molecular and cellular measurements. We develop a biophysically justified, agent-based cellular model of DCIS that is well-suited to patient-specific calibration. The model is modular in nature and can thus be readily extended to incorporate more advanced biology. We give an example of recently developed, patient-specific calibration of the model and conduct parameter studies that generate testable biological hypotheses.}},
