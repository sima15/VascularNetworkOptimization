 \boldmath Multiscale models that link sub-cellular, cellular and multicellular components offer powerful insights in disease development. Such models need a realistic set of parameters to represent the physical and chemical mechanisms at the sub-cellular and cellular levels to produce high fidelity multicellular outcomes. However, determining correct values for some of the parameters is often difficult and expensive using high-throughput microfluidic approaches. This work presents an alternative approach that estimates cellular parameters from spatiotemporal data produced from bioengineered multicellular \textit{in vitro} experiments. Specifically, we apply a search technique to an integrated cellular and multicellular model of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to estimate the binding rate and auto-regulation rate of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Understanding VEGF regulation is critical in treating age-related macular degeneration and many other diseases. The method successfully identifies realistic values for autoregulatory cellular parameters that reproduce the spatiotemporal \textit{in vitro} experimental data.
