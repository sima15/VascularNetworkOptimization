@article{qanitabaker:Mahoney2012Multiobjective,
    abstract = {{Solid tumors must recruit new blood vessels for growth and maintenance. Discovering drugs that block tumor-induced development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is an important approach in cancer treatment. The complexity of angiogenesis presents both challenges and opportunities for cancer therapies. Intuitive approaches, such as blocking VegF activity, have yielded important therapies. But there maybe opportunities to alter nonintuitive targets either alone or in combination. This paper describes the development of a high-fidelity simulation of angiogenesis and uses this as the basis for a parallel search-based approach for the discovery of novel potential cancer treatments that inhibit blood vessel growth. Discovering new therapies is viewed as a multiobjective combinatorial optimization over two competing objectives: minimizing the estimated cost of practically developing the intervention while minimizing the simulated oxygen provided to the tumor by angiogenesis. Results show the effectiveness of the search process by finding interventions that are currently in use, and more interestingly, discovering potential new approaches that are nonintuitive yet effective.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Lillacci2010Parameter,
    abstract = {{A central challenge in computational modeling of biological systems is the determination of the model parameters. Typically, only a fraction of the parameters (such as kinetic rate constants) are experimentally measured, while the rest are often fitted. The fitting process is usually based on experimental time course measurements of observables, which are used to assign parameter values that minimize some measure of the error between these measurements and the corresponding model prediction. The measurements, which can come from immunoblotting assays, fluorescent markers, etc., tend to be very noisy and taken at a limited number of time points. In this work we present a new approach to the problem of parameter selection of biological models. We show how one can use a dynamic recursive estimator, known as extended Kalman filter, to arrive at estimates of the model parameters. The proposed method follows. First, we use a variation of the Kalman filter that is particularly well suited to biological applications to obtain a first guess for the unknown parameters. Secondly, we employ an a posteriori identifiability test to check the reliability of the estimates. Finally, we solve an optimization problem to refine the first guess in case it should not be accurate enough. The final estimates are guaranteed to be statistically consistent with the measurements. Furthermore, we show how the same tools can be used to discriminate among alternate models of the same biological process. We demonstrate these ideas by applying our methods to two examples, namely a model of the heat shock response in E. coli, and a model of a synthetic gene regulation system. The methods presented are quite general and may be applied to a wide class of biological systems where noisy measurements are used for parameter estimation or model selection. Parameter estimation is a key issue in systems biology, as it represents the crucial step to obtaining predictions from computational models of biological systems. This issue is usually addressed by  ” fitting” the model simulations to the observed experimental data. Such approach does not take the measurement noise into full consideration. We introduce a new method built on the combination of Kalman filtering, statistical tests, and optimization techniques. The filter is well-known in control and estimation theory and has found application in a wide range of fields, such as inertial guidance systems, weather forecasting, and economics. We show how the statistics of the measurement noise can be optimally exploited and directly incorporated into the design of the estimation algorithm in order to achieve more accurate results, and to validate/invalidate the computed estimates. We also show that a significant advantage of our estimator is that it offers a powerful tool for model selection, allowing rejection or acceptance of competing models based on the available noisy measurements. These results are of immediate practical application in computational biology, and while we demonstrate their use for two specific examples, they can in fact be used to study a wide class of biological systems.}},

This problem is stated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic constraints. These problems are known to be frequently ill-conditioned and multimodal. Thus, traditional (gradient-based) local optimization methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost function, make them the best available candidates.}},

    abstract = {{Fitting model parameters to experimental data is a common yet often
challenging task, especially if the model contains many parameters. Typically,
algorithms get lost in regions of parameter space in which the model is
unresponsive to changes in parameters, and one is left to make adjustments by
hand. We explain this difficulty by interpreting the fitting process as a
generalized interpretation procedure. By considering the manifold of all model
predictions in data space, we find that cross sections have a hierarchy of
widths and are typically very narrow. Algorithms become stuck as they move near
the boundaries. We observe that the model manifold, in addition to being
tightly bounded, has low extrinsic curvature, leading to the use of geodesics
in the fitting process. We improve the convergence of the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm by adding the geodesic acceleration to the usual Levenberg-Marquardt
step.}},

    abstract = {{The vast computational resources that became available during the past decade enabled the development and simulation of increasingly complex mathematical models of cancer growth. These models typically involve many free parameters whose determination is a substantial obstacle to model development. Direct measurement of biochemical parameters in vivo is often difficult and sometimes impracticable, while fitting them under data-poor conditions may result in biologically implausible values. We discuss different methodological approaches to estimate parameters in complex biological models. We make use of the high computational power of the Blue Gene technology to perform an extensive study of the parameter space in a model of avascular tumor growth. We explicitly show that the landscape of the cost function used to optimize the model to the data has a very rugged surface in parameter space. This cost function has many local minima with unrealistic solutions, including the global minimum corresponding to the best fit. The case studied in this paper shows one example in which model parameters that optimally fit the data are not necessarily the best ones from a biological point of view. To avoid force-fitting a model to a dataset, we propose that the best model parameters should be found by choosing, among suboptimal parameters, those that match criteria other than the ones used to fit the model. We also conclude that the model, data and optimization approach form a new complex system and point to the need of a theory that addresses this problem more generally.}},

    abstract = {{We consider the problem of parameter estimation (model calibration) in nonlinear dynamic models of biological systems. Due to the frequent ill-conditioning and multi-modality of many of these problems, traditional local methods usually fail (unless initialized with very good guesses of the parameter vector). In order to surmount these difficulties, global optimization (GO) methods have been suggested as robust alternatives. Currently, deterministic GO methods can not solve problems of realistic size within this class in reasonable computation times. In contrast, certain types of stochastic GO methods have shown promising results, although the computational cost remains large. Rodriguez-Fernandez and coworkers have presented hybrid stochastic-deterministic GO methods which could reduce computation time by one order of magnitude while guaranteeing robustness. Our goal here was to further reduce the computational effort without loosing robustness. We have developed a new procedure based on the scatter search methodology for nonlinear optimization of dynamic models of arbitrary (or even unknown) structure (i.e. black-box models). In this contribution, we describe and apply this novel metaheuristic, inspired by recent developments in the field of operations research, to a set of complex identification problems and we make a critical comparison with respect to the previous (above mentioned) successful methods. Robust and efficient methods for parameter estimation are of key importance in systems biology and related areas. The new metaheuristic presented in this paper aims to ensure the proper solution of these problems by adopting a global optimization approach, while keeping the computational effort under reasonable values. This new metaheuristic was applied to a set of three challenging parameter estimation problems of nonlinear dynamic biological systems, outperforming very significantly all the methods previously used for these benchmark problems.}},

Recent advancements in modern high-throughput techniques have been allowing the generation of time series data that characterize the dynamics of genomic, proteomic, metabolic, and physiological responses and enable us, at least in principle, to tackle estimation and identification tasks using 'top-down' or 'inverse' approaches. While the rewards of a successful inverse estimation or identification are great, the process of extracting structural and regulatory information is technically difficult. The challenges can generally be categorized into four areas, namely, issues related to the data, the model, the mathematical structure of the system, and the optimization and support algorithms. Many recent articles have addressed inverse problems within the modeling framework of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST). BST was chosen for these tasks because of its unique structural flexibility and the fact that the structure and regulation of a biological system are mapped essentially one-to-one onto the parameters of the describing model. The proposed methods mainly focused on various optimization algorithms, but also on support techniques, including methods for circumventing the time consuming numerical integration of systems of differential equations, smoothing overly noisy data, estimating slopes of time series, reducing the complexity of the inference task, and constraining the parameter search space. Other methods targeted issues of data preprocessing, detection and amelioration of model redundancy, and model-free or model-based structure identification. The total number of proposed methods and their applications has by now exceeded one hundred, which makes it difficult for the newcomer, as well as the expert, to gain a comprehensive overview of available algorithmic options and limitations. To facilitate the entry into the field of inverse modeling within BST and related modeling areas, the article presented here reviews the field and proposes an operational 'work-flow' that guides the user through the estimation process, identifies possibly problematic steps, and suggests corresponding solutions based on the specific characteristics of the various available algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of the present state of the art and with a description of open questions.}},

It is intended for either the system biologist who wishes to learn more about the various optimization techniques available and/or the meta-heuristic optimizer who is interested in applying such techniques to problems in systems biology. First, the parameter estimation problems emerging from different areas of systems biology are described from the point of view of machine learning. Brief descriptions of various meta-heuristics developed for these problems follow, along with outlines of their advantages and disadvantages. Several important issues in applying meta-heuristics to the systems biology modelling problem are addressed, including the reliability and identifiability of model parameters, optimal design of experiments, and so on. Finally, we highlight some possible future research directions in this field.}},

Lens photographs were obtained with specially modified cameras and were graded according to codified rules by trained graders. Nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular cataracts and cataract surgery. In right eyes, incident nuclear cataract occurred in 19.4\%, cortical cataract in 17.4\%, posterior subcapsular cataract in 6.1\%, and cataract surgery in 10.8\%. Incidence increased for all end points with age. Women had significantly higher incidences of nuclear cataract and cataract surgery than men. Time trends seem to be influencing the incidence of cataract surgery. Age-related cataracts are common events in aging. Age-specific cataract surgery incidence seems to be increasing.}},

@article{qanitabaker:Ding2011Antiamyloid,
    abstract = {{Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual dysfunction worldwide. Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, Aβ1–40 (Aβ40) and Aβ1–42 (Aβ42), have been implicated previously in the AMD disease process. Consistent with a pathogenic role for Aβ, we show here that a mouse model of AMD that invokes multiple factors that are known to modify AMD risk (aged human apolipoprotein E 4 targeted replacement mice on a high-fat, cholesterol-enriched diet) presents with Aβ-containing deposits basal to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), histopathologic changes in the RPE, and a deficit in scotopic electroretinographic response, which is reflective of impaired visual function. Strikingly, these electroretinographic deficits are abrogated in a dose-dependent manner by systemic administration of an antibody targeting the C termini of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Concomitant reduction in the levels of Aβ and activated complement components in sub-RPE deposits and structural preservation of the RPE are associated with anti-Aβ40/42 antibody immunotherapy and visual protection. These observations are consistent with the reduction in amyloid plaques and improvement of cognitive function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease treated with anti-Aβ antibodies. They also implicate Aβ in the pathogenesis of AMD and identify Aβ as a viable therapeutic target for its treatment.}},

    abstract = {{In this study, we focus on a novel multi-scale modeling approach for spatiotemporal prediction of the distribution of substances and resulting hepatotoxicity by combining cellular models, a 2D liver model, and whole body model. As a case study, we focused on predicting human hepatotoxicity upon treatment with acetaminophen based on in vitro toxicity data and potential inter-individual variability in gene expression and enzyme activities. By aggregating mechanistic, genome-based in silico cells to a novel 2D liver model and eventually to a whole body model, we predicted pharmacokinetic properties, metabolism, and the onset of hepatotoxicity in an in silico patient. Depending on the concentration of acetaminophen in the liver and the accumulation of toxic metabolites, cell integrity in the liver as a function of space and time as well as changes in the elimination rate of substances were estimated. We show that the variations in elimination rates also influence the distribution of acetaminophen and its metabolites in the whole body. Our results are in agreement with experimental results. What is more, the integrated model also predicted variations in drug toxicity depending on alterations of metabolic enzyme activities. Variations in enzyme activity, in turn, reflect genetic characteristics or diseases of individuals. In conclusion, this framework presents an important basis for efficiently integrating inter-individual variability data into models, paving the way for personalized or stratified predictions of drug toxicity and efficacy.}},

    abstract = {{Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins are critical regulators of angiogenesis. VEGF concentration gradients are important for activation and chemotactic guidance of capillary sprouting, but measurement of these gradients in vivo is not currently possible. We have constructed a biophysically and molecularly detailed computational model to study microenvironmental transport of two isoforms of VEGF in rat extensor digitorum longus skeletal muscle under in vivo conditions. Using parameters based on experimental measurements, the model includes: VEGF secretion from muscle fibers; binding to the extracellular matrix; binding to and activation of endothelial cell surface VEGF receptors; and internalization. For 2-D cross sections of tissue, we analyzed predicted VEGF distributions, gradients, and receptor binding. Significant VEGF gradients (up to 12\% change in VEGF concentration over 10 mum) were predicted in resting skeletal muscle with uniform VEGF secretion, due to non-uniform capillary distribution. These relative VEGF gradients were not sensitive to extracellular matrix composition, or to the overall VEGF expression level, but were dependent on VEGF receptor density and affinity, and internalization rate parameters. VEGF upregulation in a subset of fibers increased VEGF gradients, simulating transplantation of pro-angiogenic myoblasts, a possible therapy for ischemic diseases. The number and relative position of overexpressing fibers determined the VEGF gradients and distribution of VEGF receptor activation. With total VEGF expression level in the tissue unchanged, concentrating overexpression into a small number of adjacent fibers can increase the number of capillaries activated. The VEGF concentration gradients predicted for resting muscle (average 3\% VEGF/10 mum) is sufficient for cellular sensing; the tip cell of a vessel sprout is approximately 50 mum long. The VEGF gradients also result in heterogeneity in the activation of blood vessel VEGF receptors. This first model of VEGF tissue transport and heterogeneity provides a platform for the design and evaluation of therapeutic approaches.}},

The VEGF system is complex, involving multiple ligands and receptors, along with transport throughout the body via the bloodstream. Predicting outcomes of perturbing this system, either by a single agent or combinations, can be aided by in silico models.

    abstract = {{The use of animal models in drug discovery studies presents issues with feasibility and ethical concerns. To address these limitations, in vitro tissue models have been developed to provide a means for systematic, repetitive, and quantitative investigation of drugs. By eliminating or reducing the need for animal subjects, these models can serve as platforms for more tightly controlled, high-throughput screening of drugs and for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of drugs. The focus of this review is three-dimensional (3D) tissue models that can capture cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Compared to the 2D culture of cell monolayers, 3D models more closely mimic native tissues since the cellular microenvironment established in the 3D models often plays a significant role in disease progression and cellular responses to drugs. A growing body of research has been published in the literature, which highlights the benefits of the 3D in vitro models of various tissues. This review provides an overview of some successful 3D in vitro models that have been developed to mimic liver, breast, cardiac, muscle, bone, and corneal tissues as well as malignant tissues in solid tumors.
