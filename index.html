		Abstract
	</h3>

	<p>
		Efficient metabolism in bioengineered tissues requires
		a robust vascular system to provide healthy microenvironments
		to the cells and stroma. Such networks form spontaneously
		during embryogenesis from randomly distributed endothelial
		cells. There is a need to bioengineer endothelial cells so that
		network formation and operation is optimal for synthetic tissues.
		This work introduces a computational model that simulates de
		novo vascular development and assesses the effectiveness of the
		network in delivering nutrients and extracting waste from tissue.
		A genetic algorithm was employed to identify parameter values of
		the vaculogenesis model that lead to the most efficient and robust
		vascular structures. These parameter values control the behavior
		of cell-level mechanisms such as chemotaxis and adhesion. These
		studies demonstrate that genetic algorithms are effective at identifying
		model parameters that lead to near-optimal networks. This
		work suggests that computational modeling and optimization
		approaches may improve the effectiveness of engineered tissues
		by suggesting target cellular mechanisms for modification.

		  Introduction
	</h3>

	<p>
		Multicellular organisms depend on vascular systems for
		nutrient delivery and waste removal. These vascular networks
		are formed either through vasculogenesis, a biological
		process in which scattered vessel precursor cells self-organize
		to create new networks or through angiogenesis, in which new
		vessels sprout from the existing vessels.   
	</p>
	<p>
		Both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are driven primarily
		by chemotaxis, a mechanism in which cells move in response
		to a chemical gradient, along with cell-cell adhesion.
		While many questions remain, progress in understanding and
		exploiting both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis is being made
		from a bioengineering perspective. Dahl et al.
		successfully implanted tissue-engineered vascular grafts in
		baboons and dogs. Melero-Martin et al. showed that
		robust development of functional vascular networks is possible
		in vivo.
	</p>
	<p>
		With additional research in this area, bioengineered cells
		could be used to form functional vascular networks to create
		a useful delivery mechanism in synthetic tissues. However,
		to apply bioengineering approaches to vascular cells, genetic
		targets need to be identified that when modified, improve the
		effectiveness of the vascular systems that emerge. Given the
		vast number of possible targets, a method is required that could
		assist engineers in identifying those genetic targets.
	</p>
	<p>
		This paper presents a proof-of-concept genetic algorithm
		approach to solving this problem. The genetic algorithm
		acts to modify a computational model of vascular network
		development embedded within a cell cultivation environment.
		The search space of the optimization are the values of model
		parameters which control the mechanisms of the vascular cells
		such as chemotaxis. Changing these parameters modifies the
		behavior of individual cells which ultimately influence the
		spatial organization of the emergent vascular network. To
		evaluate the quality of this network, the model simulates its
		operation by determining fluid flow through each vessel, and
		subsequent nutrient delivery to the cultured cells. The returned
		fitness value quantifies the total metabolic activity of culture
		by using bioengineered microbial cells and measuring the total
		product produced.

		Genetic Algorithm Method
	</h3>

	<p>
		The self organizing vascular model has seven parameters
		with unknown values (Table 1). The best fit for these parameters
		was found using a genetic algorithm from the Java Genetic
		Algorithms Package [4]. The seven parameters are used as
		genes in individual chromosomes. The initial population had
		a size of three and was constructed by random selection of
		parameter values from the ranges shown in Table II. As the
		population evolves during runs of the genetic algorithm, each
		individual is evaluated using the parameter values encoded in
		the genes used to run the vascular model. 
		The resulting vascular network is then evaluated, 
		and the fitness is assigned based on
		the metabolic production. Next, genetic operators were run on
		the population followed by a re-evaluation of the population
		that now contained new individuals. Finally, selection was
		applied to obtain the new population for the next round of
		evolution. Crossover and mutation operators were included
		in the genetic algorithm, with the crossover operator applied
		to 35% of the population per generation and the mutation
		operator was applied to each gene with a probability of
		1/12. An elitist ranking selector cloned the top %90 of the
		population, with the remaining 10% of the population filled
		with the same individuals in the order of fitness. The results
		presented in this paper were obtained using 1000 steps of
		evolution.

		Conclusion
	</h3>

	<p>
		This study presents an attempt to optimize a vascular network of endothelial-like cells using genetic algorithm. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This work has shown that genetic algorithms are sufficiently
		powerful to optimize complex biological systems, even when
		there is a non-linear relationship between the parameters and
		the fitness function. This method can be applied to models
		of different biological systems that consider alternative objectives.
