		Abstract
	</h3>

	<p>
		Efficient metabolism in bioengineered tissues requires
a robust vascular system to provide healthy microenvironments
to the cells and stroma. Such networks form spontaneously
during embryogenesis from randomly distributed endothelial
cells. There is a need to bioengineer endothelial cells so that
network formation and operation is optimal for synthetic tissues.
This work introduces a computational model that simulates de
novo vascular development and assesses the effectiveness of the
network in delivering nutrients and extracting waste from tissue.
A genetic algorithm was employed to identify parameter values of
the vaculogenesis model that lead to the most efficient and robust
vascular structures. These parameter values control the behavior
of cell-level mechanisms such as chemotaxis and adhesion. These
studies demonstrate that genetic algorithms are effective at identifying
model parameters that lead to near-optimal networks. This
work suggests that computational modeling and optimization
approaches may improve the effectiveness of engineered tissues
by suggesting target cellular mechanisms for modification.

		  Introduction
	</h3>

	<p>
		Multicellular organisms depend on vascular systems for
		nutrient delivery and waste removal [20]. These vascular networks
		are formed either through vasculogenesis, a biological
		process in which scattered vessel precursor cells self-organize
		to create new networks or through angiogenesis, in which new
		vessels sprout from the existing vessels.   
	</p>
	<p>
		Both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are driven primarily
		by chemotaxis, a mechanism in which cells move in response
		to a chemical gradient, along with cell-cell adhesion [19].
		While many questions remain, progress in understanding and
		exploiting both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis is being made
		from a bioengineering perspective [11] [14]. Dahl et al. [23]
		successfully implanted tissue-engineered vascular grafts in
		baboons and dogs. Melero-Martin et al. [18] showed that
		robust development of functional vascular networks is possible
		in vivo.
	</p>
	<p>
		With additional research in this area, bioengineered cells
		could be used to form functional vascular networks to create
		a useful delivery mechanism in synthetic tissues. However,
		to apply bioengineering approaches to vascular cells, genetic
		targets need to be identified that when modified, improve the
		effectiveness of the vascular systems that emerge. Given the
		vast number of possible targets, a method is required that could
		assist engineers in identifying those genetic targets.
	</p>
	<p>
		This paper presents a proof-of-concept genetic algorithm
		approach to solving this problem. The genetic algorithm
		acts to modify a computational model of vascular network
		development embedded within a cell cultivation environment.
		The search space of the optimization are the values of model
		parameters which control the mechanisms of the vascular cells
		such as chemotaxis. Changing these parameters modifies the
		behavior of individual cells which ultimately influence the
		spatial organization of the emergent vascular network. To
		evaluate the quality of this network, the model simulates its
		operation by determining fluid flow through each vessel, and
		subsequent nutrient delivery to the cultured cells. The returned
		fitness value quantifies the total metabolic activity of culture
		by using bioengineered microbial cells and measuring the total
		product produced.

		  Method
	</h3>

	<p>
		Genetic algorithm which is useful in optimization problems, was used to determine the best values for the set of parameters
		under research. The program would search the space for a set of parameter values which would result in an optimized network
		of vascular cells. In this project, the network was evaluated visually for fitness, specifically considering the number of 
		lacunae formed in the simulation world. Obviously, formation of higher number of lacunae means availability of nutrients 
		and access to removal system to more producer cells and consequently a higher productivity of the cell culture. 
	</p>
   	 <p> 
		 JGAP package from MOEA framework was used for the genetic algorithm creation. Initial population was set to include
		 2 Chromosomes. Each chromosome consisted of 7 genes, the parameters being evaluated. A validity range was assigned to
		 each gene so that the algorithm would choose values in the range. Initial population values were set randomly. The 
		 algorithm was set to stop executing after 30 iterations.  
	</p>
	<h5 class="title2">
		 Parameters:
	  </h5>
	<p>
		The parameters used in the GA included chemo-attractant force response relevant to vascular and circulatory cells,
		chemo-attractant reaction of the vascular network consisting of chemo-attractant production rate, decay rate, and
		half-saturation, and finally chemo-attractant reaction of the circulatory cells comprising chemo-attractant 
		production and decay rate. 	
	</p>
	<h5 class="title2">
	  Parameter ranges:
	  </h5>
	<p>
		The parameter ranges included a substantially different ranges starting from ( 0.0000000001, 0.001 ) for 
		chemo-attractant decay rate for circulatory cells to ( 1 , 7 ) for chemo-attractant production rate of vascular 
		cells depending on the type of parameter.

		    Conclusion
	</h3>

	<p>
		This study presents an attempt to optimize a vascular network of endothelial-like cells using genetic algorithm. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This work has shown that genetic algorithms are sufficiently
		powerful to optimize complex biological systems, even when
		there is a non-linear relationship between the parameters and
		the fitness function. This method can be applied to models
		of different biological systems that consider alternative objectives.
