	<p>Current bioengineered cell factories suffer from productivity limitations caused by inefficient nutrient delivery and waste and product removal. While solutions currently adopted include modification of the physical configuration of bioreactors, another computational work [reference] attempts at introducing a set of endothelial-like cells into the factory. The mentioned cells from a vascular network over a short time and function as a medium of nutrient delivery and product and waste removal; hence, increasing the productivity of the cell culture.
         The formation of such a vascular network requires different conditions to be met. The percentage of the endothelial-like cells directly affects the quality of the created network. While many biological parameters need to be set for successful simulation of the process, various biomechanical factors, as well as their values also should be inserted. An XML file contains a record of the mentioned parameters. 
         This work seeks to optimize the vascular network being created. It attempts at finding the most precise values for a set of biological parameters which the author  believes to have a significant impact on the quality of the network of cells. The quality mentioned includes a smooth and consistent spread of the vascular cells among producer cells in the culture, fewest possible disconnections of the network and close to the average area inside each lacuna.

<a id="method" class="anchor" href="#method" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Method
	  </h3>

	<p>Genetic algorithm which is useful in optimization problems, was used to determine the best values for the set of parameters under research. The program would search the space for a set of
	  parameter values which would result in an optimized network of vascular cells. In this project, the network was evaluated visually 
	  for fitness, specifically considering the number of lacunae formed in the simulation world. Obviously, formation of higher number of
	  lacunae means availability of nutrients and access to removal system to more producer cells and consequently a higher productivity of 
	  the cell culture. 
	</p>
   	 <p> JGAP package from MOEA framework was used for the genetic algorithm creation. Initial population was set to include 2 Chromosomes. Each chromosome consisted of 7 genes, the parameters being evaluated. A validity range was assigned to each gene so that the algorithm would choose values in the range. Initial population values were set randomly. The algorithm was set to stop executing after 30 iterations.  
	<h4>
		 Parameters:
	  </h4>
	  The parameters used in the GA included chemo-attractant force response relevant to vascular and circulatory cells, chemo-attractant reaction of the vascular network consisting of chemo-attractant production rate, decay rate, and half-saturation, and finally chemo-attractant reaction of the circulatory cells comprising chemo-attractant production and decay rate. 
	<h4>
	  Parameter ranges:
	  </h4>   
		The parameter ranges included a substantially different ranges starting from ( 0.0000000001, 0.001 ) for chemo-attractant decay rate for circulatory cells to ( 1 , 7 ) for chemo-attractant production rate of vascular cells depending on the type of parameter. 
	     Time was the biggest constraint in the present study. In order to reduce its effect, the study used a rather small sized simulation world considering vascular cells only. The regular simulation time originally was approximately 24 hours which using the mentioned
	      method was reduced to about 4 hours. Another short coming of this work, was the inability of our program to calculate the amount of product for every simulation,
	      therefore, even if our GA would reach interesting results, the second limitation would prevent us from getting suitable results.

<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This study presents an attempt to optimize a vascular network of endothelial-like cells using genetic algorithm.
The results show a 20% improvement in the productivity of the cell culture using the current approach. 
Time was the biggest constraint in the present study. In order to reduce its effect, the study used a rather small sized simulation world where cells and
  gaps among them appear bigger than they should. Therefore, the image processing algorithm adopted was modified to ignore small gaps and dilate vascular cells.
  Consequently, the vascular network was assumed to be larger and thicker than it was in reality and caused a portion of unreal increase in the productivity of the system. This issue did not have a huge impact on the result of the genetic algorithm since the results were all produced the same way. However, as future work a more precise image processing method would definitely improve the results.    </p>
