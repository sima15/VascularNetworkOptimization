<p>Current work attempts to optimize a computationally formed vascular network of endothelial-like cells inside a cell culture. A genetic algorithm is used to get the best parameter values for the creation of this network.</p>

<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Current bioengineered cell factories suffer from productivity limitations caused by inefficient nutrient delivery and waste and product removal. While solutions currently adopted include modification of the physical configuration of bioreactors, another computational work [reference] attempts at introducing a set of endothelial-like cells into the factory. The mentioned cells from a vascular network over a short time and function as a medium of nutrient delivery and product and waste removal; hence, increasing the productivity of the cell culture.<br>
         The formation of such a vascular network requires different conditions to be met. The percentage of the endothelial-like cells directly affects the quality of the created network. While many biological parameters need to be set for successful simulation of the process, various biomechanical factors, as well as their values also should be inserted. An XML file contains a record of the mentioned parameters. 
         This work seeks to optimize the vascular network being created. It attempts at finding the most precise values for a set of biological parameters which the author  believes to have a significant impact on the quality of the network of cells. The quality mentioned includes a smooth and consistent spread of the vascular cells among producer cells in the culture, fewest possible disconnections of the network and close to the average area inside each lacuna.

<a id="method" class="anchor" href="#method" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Method</h3>

<p>Genetic algorithm which is useful in optimization problems was used to determine the best values for the set of given parameters. 
JGAP package from MOEA framework was used for the genetic algorithm creation. Initial population was set to include 5 Chromosomes. Each chromosome consisted of 9 genes, the parameters being evaluated. A validity range was assigned to each gene so that the algorithm would choose values in the range. Initial population was set randomly. The algorithm was set to stop executing at 20 iterations.</p>

<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This study presents an attempt to optimize a vascular network of endothelial-like cells using genetic algorithm.
The results show a 200% improvement in the productivity of the cell culture using the current approach. 
Time was the biggest constraint in the present study. In order to reduce its effect, the study used a rather small sized simulation world where cells and gaps among them appear bigger than they should. Therefore, the image processing algorithm adopted was modified to ignore small gaps and regard them as vascular cells. Consequently, the vascular network was assumed to be larger and thicker than it was in reality and caused a portion of unreal increase in the productivity of the system. This issue did not have a huge impact on the result of the genetic algorithm since the results were all produced the same way. However, as future work a more precise image processing method would definitely improve the results.    </p>
